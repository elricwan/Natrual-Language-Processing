But it turned out she didn't hear what I said and put $80 cash and $70 on the card. So when i asked her if she wanted more money she kept saying I just wanted to see if you were not happy with my service and to be honest no i was not especially after doing what she did in front of the kids. First one of the kids asked her for a spoon so she could eat her chocolate dessert it took her so long that we asked another server for a spoon and we got that spoon way before our normal waitress then my kid gives me the spoon and asked me to hide it because she didn't want for the waitress to get mad.
