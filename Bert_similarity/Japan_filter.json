{"In leaderless Hong Kong movement, Joshua Wong just 1 voice,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Overseas, Joshua Wong has emerged as a prominent face of Hong Kong's months-long protests for full democracy. At home, he is just another protester.The 22-year-old activist, who rose to fame as a leader of democracy protests five years ago, speaks to a U.S. congressional committee on Tuesday, following visits to Germany and Taiwan to drum up support for the movement.While not diminishing the importance of that role, other protesters say Wong does not speak for what is purposefully a leaderless movement. He has received media coverage, both because he is well-known and the movement is largely faceless, since many protesters speak only anonymously and wear masks to try to avoid arrest.\"Not that nobody cares about what he says, but it's just that Joshua Wong alone cannot represent the whole of Hong Kong,\" said Sean Au, a 17-year-old student. \"He is just a participant, no longer a leader.\"His activities have nonetheless made him a target of the Chinese government, which has used him to accuse foreign powers of colluding with anti-China separatists to foment unrest.Wong's activism started at age 13 when he joined protests against a proposed high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and mainland China. The link opened last year after many delays.The bespectacled teen set up a student activist group, Scholarism, months later and rallied more than 100,000 people to protest a plan to implement mandatory patriotic education in schools. The government eventually dropped the plan.It was the 2014 Umbrella Revolution that propelled Wong into the global spotlight. Protesters occupied major thoroughfares in the semiautonomous Chinese territory for 79 days in an ultimately unsuccessful push for direct elections for the city's leaders.Wong co-founded a political party, Demosisto, in 2016, but its members were disqualified from serving and later even running for office because they advocated self-determination. He remains secretary-general of the organization, which now describes itself on Twitter as a movement-oriented youth activist group.Wong, who has been arrested and jailed repeatedly, was released in June, days after more than a million people took to the streets to protest an extradition bill which is widely regarded as an example of China chipping away at the city's autonomy.He was rearrested last month along with several others and charged with organizing an illegal rally outside a police station in June.While Wong has inspired many, neither he nor other well-known individuals or groups have a central role in this summer's mass movement, said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several massive marches this summer.Leung acknowledged that Wong's reputation as the poster child of the 2014 protest gives him stature as a protest representative on the global stage, along with others such as Hong Kong pop star Denise Ho.\"Globally we need actions that will make (the Hong Kong and Beijing governments) think twice before they act,\" she said. \"Joshua Wong is a well-known face across the world and he can help in this.\"Wong and Ho are among five people due to speak at a hearing of the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China titled \"Hong Kong's Summer of Discontent and U.S. Policy Responses.\"They hope to rally support for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill proposing economic sanctions and penalties on Chinese and Hong Kong officials found to have suppressed democracy in the city.Mousse Chan, a 45-year-old teacher, said she supports Wong in his global tour, though she echoed the view that he is not their leader.\"We believe that every Hong Kong citizen has a responsibility to raise awareness about our cause and he is just one of them,\" she said.Wong has accused the government of trying to frame prominent activists such as himself as a warning to other protesters, but he said it was doomed to fail as the current unrest has no centralized figureheads.Born in 1996 to a middle-class Christian family, Wong has said his passion was ignited after his father started taking him to poorer areas when he was a young child. He has written a book called \"I Am Not a Hero\" and featured in a Netflix documentary entitled \"Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower.\"Ahead of his trip to Germany this month, he made headlines in Berlin after suggesting that two panda cubs--born to pandas rented from China at the Berlin Zoo--be named \"Democracy\" and \"Freedom\" to send a clear signal to China.He later compared Hong Kong with East Germany during the pro-democracy protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Beijing has rebuked German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas for meeting Wong, saying he disrespected China's sovereignty.Wong tweeted Sunday that human rights clauses should be included in the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China.\"I see no reason for us to give up and it's time for the world to stand with Hong Kong,\" he said.", "Amid protests, Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downgrades Hong Kong to \u00e2\u0080\u0098negative\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,September,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Credit rating agency Moody's changed its outlook on Hong Kong's rating to negative from stable on Monday, reflecting what it called the rising risk of \"an erosion in the strength of Hong Kong's institutions\" amid the city's ongoing protests.The move follows Fitch Ratings' downgrade earlier this month on Hong Kong's long-term foreign-currency-issuer default rating to \"AA\" from \"AA+.\"\"Moody's has previously noted that a downgrade could be triggered by a shift in the current equilibrium between the SAR's (Special Administrative Region's) economic proximity to and legal and regulatory distance from China,\" Moody's said in a statement.\"The decision to change Hong Kong's outlook to negative signals rising concern that this shift is happening, notwithstanding recent moves by Hong Kong's government to accommodate some of the demonstrators' demands.\"Hong Kong's financial secretary Paul Chan said the city's government disagrees with Moody's assessment and that the inference is \"not founded on facts.\"\"In spite of the concern over the recent social incidents, Hong Kong's financial markets and its banking system have been functioning normally in the past few months. The Linked Exchange Rate System has been operating smoothly. Banks remain well capitalized with ample liquidity,\" he said in a statement.The institutional features that grant Hong Kong greater political and economic autonomy--together with the city's intrinsic credit strengths--accounted for Hong Kong's higher rating than China, the agency said.On Sunday, what began as a mostly peaceful protest descended into violence in some of the Chinese territory's busiest shopping and tourist districts. The demonstrations were the latest in over three months of sometimes violent protests.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, told a group of businessmen in late August that her \"political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited,\" because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China.The longer the standoff continues, the greater the risk that Hong Kong's attractiveness as a global economic and financial center would be diminished, Moody's said. Dwindling capacity for the government to implement certain policies could \"undermine key drivers of its competitiveness and macroeconomic stability.\"Moody's affirmed Hong Kong's Aa2 rating, however, citing \"strong fiscal and external buffers, with a minimal government debt burden, large fiscal reserves and ample foreign exchange reserves.\"It said it would \"likely downgrade Hong Kong's rating\" if it concluded the protests, or measures taken by the Hong Kong government to resolve them, were likely to damage Hong Kong's medium-term economic prospects, or \"signify an erosion in the predictability and effectiveness of its governing, judicial and policymaking institutions.\"Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, said the rating action by the rating agencies was an early indicator and warning signal.\"I don't think there will be aggressive markets in the short run. The impact will come in the medium term. Some quasi-government agencies may need to pay higher funding costs should the third credit rating agency (S&P) downgrade Hong Kong.\"The Hong Kong dollar was little changed at 7.8201 per U.S. dollar. The currency is pegged to the dollar at a tight range of 7.75-7.85.", "Taiwan: China meddling with elections after Solomon Islands cuts ties,REUTERS,September,17,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan accused China on Monday of trying to influence its presidential and legislative elections after the Solomon Islands cut off ties with Taipei.The Solomon Islands was the sixth country to switch allegiance to China since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in Taiwan in 2016. Its decision on Monday dealt her a new blow in her struggle to secure re-election in January amid criticism of her handling of Beijing and rising tension with China.Self-ruled Taiwan now has formal relations with only 16 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.China claims Taiwan as its territory and says it has no right to formal ties with any nation.Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Tsai said Taiwan would not bow to Chinese pressure, describing the Solomon Islands' decision as new evidence that Beijing is trying to meddle in the January elections.\"Over the past few years, China has continually used financial and political pressure to suppress Taiwan's international space,\" Tsai said, calling the Chinese move \"a brazen challenge and detriment to the international order.\"\"I want to emphasize that Taiwan will not engage in dollar diplomacy with China in order to satisfy unreasonable demands,\" she said.China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said Taipei would immediately close its embassy in the Solomon Islands and recall all its diplomats.\"The Chinese government attacked Taiwan purposely before our presidential and legislative elections, obviously aiming to meddle with the voting. The government strongly condemns this and urges people to hold on to its sovereignty and the value of freedom and democracy,\" said Wu, whose resignation was rejected by Tsai. \"Taiwan has never bowed to pressure from one single setback, and it won't be defeated by this blow,\" Wu said, urging support from allies in the region to defend Taiwan's freedom and democracy.China has been trying to secure allies from Taiwan, and Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama and El Salvador had already cut off ties with Taipei.Beijing has stepped up pressure to squeeze the island, which have included regular Chinese bomber patrols around Taiwan, since Tsai took office. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for Beijing.Tsai said the Chinese move could be an \"attempt to divert attention\" from months of protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, and that China was forcing Taiwan to accept a formula similar to Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\" arrangement, which guarantees certain freedoms.\"I am confident that the 23 million people of Taiwan have this to say in response: not a chance.\" A senior official familiar with Taiwan's security planning told Reuters Beijing had issued an \"urgent order\" to secure the Solomon Islands' allegiance \"at any cost\" on Sunday night, and called it a move to distract domestic attention from the Hong Kong issue before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1.The protests in Hong Kong pose the biggest challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.The source said the rupture in ties had prompted expressions of concern from countries including the United States, Australia and New Zealand, who had been involved in efforts to help Taiwan secure ties with the Solomon Islands.The Solomon Islands' decision followed a months-long review of the pros and cons of a switch to Beijing, which was offering $8.5 million in development funds to replace support from Taiwan.In a cabinet vote on Monday, there were 27 votes to shift ties and six abstentions, creating an \"overwhelming\" majority, a Solomon Islands member of parliament told Reuters. The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to questions.", "Hospital staff rally for protest campaign after new violence,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Hundreds of medical staff at one of Hong Kong's main public hospitals rallied Monday to support months of protests for democratic reforms and denounce police use of force, after new violence over the weekend rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Staff at the Prince of Wales Hospital, many wearing black surgical masks, sang protest songs, chanted slogans and formed a human chain, urging the government to resolve the conflict by acceding to protesters' demands, including direct elections for the city's leader and police accountability.\"I hope Hong Kong will be peaceful again. I hope police will stop indiscriminate arrests and their excessive use of force,\" said a nurse who wanted to be identified only as Ching.Hospital staff have held several rallies in support of the protest movement. However, about 500 doctors in a letter published in two newspapers on Monday supported the police handling of the crisis and said violence shouldn't be glorified.The hospital rally came after a pro-democracy march on Sunday in downtown Hong Kong descended into chaos.Thousands of people, black-clad masked protesters alongside families with children, defied a police ban and peacefully marched 2 kilometers from the Causeway Bay shopping district to the central business district. Police had turned down the march permit, but the demonstrators were undeterred, as they have been all summer.Some protesters later burned Chinese flags and vandalized subway stations. Hundreds of them targeted government buildings, throwing bricks and gasoline bombs through police barriers. Police responded by firing volleys of tear gas and using water cannon trucks to spray pepper-laced water as well as blue liquid that helped police identify offenders. Protesters retreated but regrouped in cat-and-mouse battles lasting a few hours before calm returned.Pro-Beijing supporters turned up at the North Point and Fortress Hill neighborhoods late Sunday, leading to brawls. Police said Monday that people used hammers and other weapons to attack each other, leading to a number of injuries and forcing police to deploy tear gas.Police official Tse Chun-Chung said \"radical protesters escalated their violent acts\" including throwing more than 80 gasoline bombs in the melee Sunday, briefly setting a water cannon on fire. He said some landed on other demonstrators.In one case, he said protesters hurled gasoline bombs at two police officers, who were forced to take out their pistols as a warning. Tse said the mob also assaulted pro-government supporters, including a man who was beaten until he was unconscious.Police have detained 89 people since Friday, bringing the total arrests to 1,453 since the protests started in June, he said. He said police will step up enforcement, and that \"everyone is a loser\" with the persistent violence.The Hospital Authority said 28 people were hospitalized Sunday.The government has slammed the illegal acts. It reiterated in a statement Sunday that violence would only harm the community and that it was sincerely trying to solve problems through a dialogue.The anti-government protests, sparked by an extradition bill that many Hong Kong residents see as an example of the territory's autonomy being eroded under Chinese rule, have been increasingly marked by violence and clashes with police.The government's decision this month to withdraw the bill was seen by the protesters as too little, too late. Their demands have widened, and some of the more confrontational protesters defend violence as necessary because peaceful demonstrations haven't resulted in change.In Geneva, Hong Kong lawmaker Tanya Chan urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to probe alleged police brutality against protesters. Chan said police, who have called protesters cockroaches, were carrying out \"pest control to curb free speech.\"The unrest has battered Hong Kong's economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.Protesters have vowed to keep up their protests ahead of the Oct. 1 celebration of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's 70th year in power. The Civil Human Rights Front, whose permit for the Sunday march was denied, plans rallies on Sept. 28 and Oct. 1. Several previous rallies organized by the group drew massive crowds.Eric Lai, coordinator for the group, said police have banned its rallies to silence peaceful protesters but that it only led to more anger.\"Dialogue is meaningless if the government refuses to respond to the people's demands,\" he said.", "Hong Kong reopens after weekend of clashes, protests,REUTERS,September,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's businesses and metro stations reopened as usual on Monday after a chaotic Sunday when police fired water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who blocked roads and threw petrol bombs outside government headquarters.On Sunday what began as a mostly peaceful protest earlier in the day spiraled into violence in some of the Chinese territory's busiest shopping and tourist districts.Thousands of anti-government protesters, many clad in black masks, caps and shades to obscure their identity, raced through the streets, engaging in cat-and-mouse tactics with police, setting street fires and blocking roads in the heart of Hong Kong where many key business districts are located.The demonstrations are the latest in nearly four months of sometimes violent protests. Protesters are furious over what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in Hong Kong's affairs despite promises by Beijing to grant the city wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms denied in mainland China.Dozens of university students rallied peacefully on Monday afternoon urging authorities to listen to public demands. Dressed in black, some of them donning face masks, students sang \"Glory to Hong Kong\" a song that has become a rallying cry for more democratic freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese hub.At Baptist University hundreds of students also marched to demand the university's management offer support to a student reporter arrested on Sunday.The initial trigger for the protests was a contentious extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.The protests have since broadened into other demands including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into allegations of excessive force by the police.Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland--including a much-cherished independent legal system.Kung Lui, a third-year university student majoring in sociology, said the protests would continue until all five demands were met. \"The protests have revealed lots of social problems and proved that democracy and freedom are the core values of Hong Kong people.\"Police on Monday said 89 people were arrested over the weekend after \"radical protesters\" attacked two police officers on Sunday evening, hurling petrol bombs, bricks and threatening the safety of the officers.Nearly 1,500 people have been arrested since the protests started in June.Authorities moved quickly to douse the fires and police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse them, including in the bustling shopping and tourist district of Causeway Bay.At least 18 people were injured, three of them seriously, during Sunday's violence, according to the Hospital Authority.The protests have weighed on the city's economy as it faces its first recession in a decade, with tourist arrivals plunging 40 percent in August amid some disruptions at the city's international airport.By Sunday evening, the running battles between anti-government protesters and police had evolved into street brawls between rival groups in the districts of Fortress Hill and North Point further east on Hong Kong island. There, men in white T-shirts--believed to be pro-Beijing supporters and some wielding hammers, rods and knives--clashed with anti-government activists.On a street close to North Point, home to a large pro-Beijing community, a Reuters witness saw one man in a white T-shirt sprawled on the ground with head wounds.Hong Kong media reported that groups of pro-Beijing supporters had attacked journalists.Police eventually intervened and sealed off some roads to try to restore order, and they were seen taking away several men and women from an office run by a pro-Beijing association.Democratic lawmaker Ted Hui was arrested for allegedly obstructing police, according to his Democratic Party's Facebook page, as he tried to mediate on the streets in North Point.", "Violence flares after Hong Kong protesters defy police ban,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Police fired chemical-laced blue water and tear gas at protesters who lobbed Molotov cocktails outside the Hong Kong government office complex Sunday, as violence flared anew after thousands of pro-democracy supporters marched through downtown in defiance of a police ban.A mixed crowd of hardcore protesters in black and wearing masks, along with families with children, spilled into the roads of the Causeway Bay shopping belt and marched for over 2 kilometers to the central business district. Some waved U.S. and British flags, while others carried posters reiterating their calls for democratic reforms.Police had turned down a request by the Civil Human Rights Front to hold the march, but the demonstrators were undeterred, as they've been all summer.\"I feel this is our duty.

In familiar scenes, some protesters smashed glass windows and surveillance cameras at a subway station exit.Hundreds of protesters later targeted the government office complex, throwing bricks and gasoline bombs through police barriers. Police responded by firing volleys of tear gas and using water cannon trucks to spray chemical-laced water as well as blue liquid that helped them identify offenders, in a repeat of confrontational scenes from the last several weeks of the protests.Protesters retreated but regrouped in the nearby Wan Chai neighborhood, setting fires outside a subway station exit and on the streets. They fled again after riot police advanced and the cat-and-mouse battles went on for a few hours before calm returned.Police fired tear gas again later in the nearby North Point area after protesters obstructed traffic after brawling there earlier with pro-government supporters.Hospital authorities said eight people were injured throughout the day, including three in serious condition.The protests were triggered in June by an extradition bill that many saw as an example of China's increasing intrusion and at chipping away at Hong Kong residents' freedoms and rights, many of which are not accorded to people in mainland China.Hong Kong's government promised this month to withdraw the bill, which would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city's leaders and police accountability.More than 1,300 people have been arrested amid increasing clashes between protesters and police, who demonstrators have accused of abuses.The unrest has battered Hong Kong's economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.Earlier Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved British flags, sang \"God Save the Queen\" and chanted \"UK save Hong Kong\" outside the British Consulate as they stepped up calls for international support for their campaign.With banners declaring \"one country, two systems is dead,\" they repeated calls for Hong Kong's former colonial ruler to ensure the city's autonomy is upheld under agreements made when Britain ceded power to China in 1997.Demonstrators held similar rallies Sept. 1 at the British Consulate and last weekend at the U.S. Consulate.On Saturday, pro-democracy protesters and supporters of the central government in Beijing clashed at a Hong Kong shopping mall and several public places. Police arrested more than a dozen people and hospital authorities said 25 were injured.The clashes amid the mid-autumn festival holiday came after several nights of peaceful rallies that featured protesters belting out a new protest song in mass singing at shopping malls.

No specific investments were discussed or agreed upon, they said.The SOEs in attendance included oil giant Sinopec and conglomerate China Merchants Group, one of the sources said.The meeting was organized by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the powerful central body that oversees China's sprawling state sector, which includes some of the world's biggest companies in industries such as steel, energy, shipping and telecoms.SASAC did not respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. Officials at Sinopec and China Merchants Group did not respond to emailed requests for comment and calls to the two companies went unanswered.Instead of simply holding stakes in Hong Kong companies, the Chinese SOEs were also urged to look to control companies and have decision-making power in them, one of the people familiar with the meeting said.\"The business elites in Hong Kong are certainly not doing enough. Most of them are just not one of us,\" the SOE executive who was at the meeting told Reuters.SASAC's Communist Party chief, Hao Peng, appeared in Hong Kong on Wednesday at a forum for the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative and said that SOEs were looking for ways to cooperate in major projects in the city, according to a SASAC news release.Hao, who was accompanied by a group of SOE executives, also met with Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive.While China's big state firms are for-profit enterprises and many are publicly traded, they have long been expected to do national service, including maintaining high levels of employment and helping Beijing execute initiatives such as its big Belt and Road infrastructure plan.Months of huge and often-violent protests in Hong Kong were triggered by planned legislation that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland courts. The protests have been fueled by what is seen by many in Hong Kong as creeping Chinese influence that is a eroding the \"one country, two systems\" model under which China has ruled Hong Kong since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997.Widening mainland influence in Hong Kong has included the purchase of corporate assets and real estate.The Hong Kong economy was once dominated by British trading houses with roots in the 19th century. Local tycoons started to take over many of the businesses in the latter part of the 20th century, creating huge conglomerates such as Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings.Beijing has been willing to put pressure on Hong Kong businesses to be more patriotic, expressing unhappiness during an August meeting with the city's business elites that they weren't doing enough to quiet the protests, according to a report at the time by the state-run Xinhua news agency.In the meeting last month with about 500 business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians from Hong Kong, Chinese authorities urged that they should \"have no fears and stand up\" to stop violence in the city, Xinhua reported.Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., a legacy of Hong Kong's colonial era, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after Beijing demanded it suspend staff who support the demonstrations. Its chairman announced plans to step down in November, less than three weeks after CEO Rupert Hogg left amid mounting regulatory scrutiny.Hong Kong subway operator MTR Corp. also bowed to pressure in August to get tough on anti-government protesters after Chinese state media expressed dismay at the firm for its perceived facilitation of the spread of violence by protesters.", "Lam to prioritize housing, jobs to appease HK protesters,REUTERS,September,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has promised to prioritize housing and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihoods to appease deep rooted discontent about the way the Asian financial hub has been governed, as protesters gear up for fresh demonstrations.Lam, who said she caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by igniting the political crisis and would quit if she had a choice, said in a Facebook post late on Thursday her government would increase the supply of housing with more policies to be announced.While the spark for the protests that have rocked Hong Kong was a now-withdrawn extradition bill and concern Beijing was eroding civil liberties, many young protesters are also angry at sky-high living costs and a lack of future job prospects.Hong Kong has some of the world's most expensive real estate and many young people say the city's housing policy is unfair, benefiting the rich, while forcing them to live with their parents or rent \"shoe box\" apartments at exorbitant prices.Lam's comments come as activists plan the latest in a series of protests in the former British colony, which is grappling with its biggest political crisis in decades.The demonstrations started more than three months ago in response to an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, but have broadened into calls for greater democracy.On Friday, demonstrators are set to carry lanterns and form human chains on the scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.Sit-ins at shopping malls and another \"stress test\" of the airport are also planned over the weekend. The international airport has in recent weeks seen the blocking of access roads, street fires and vandalism of a nearby subway station.Activists also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to demand that China honors the Sino-British Joint Declaration that was signed in 1984, laying out the former British colony's future after its handover to China in 1997.China says Hong Kong is now its internal affair. Britain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by its obligations under the Joint Declaration.Hong Kong returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system.China denies meddling and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest.Police have responded to violence with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannon and baton charges, as well as firing several live shots in the air, prompting complaints of excessive force.On Thursday Hong Kong's government rejected a warning from a Canadian think tank that the city's position as one of the world's freest economies is threatened by China's \"heavy hand\" as anti-government protesters gear up for fresh protests.Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as a result of the protests.The Fraser Institute, an independent public policy research organization, said Hong Kong was one of the most economically free jurisdictions in the world but \"interference from China, including the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests, severely threatens Hong Kong's rule of law.\"Hong Kong's government said the comments were \"entirely ungrounded and not borne out by objective facts,\" with human rights and freedom fully protected, according to a statement released late on Thursday.", "As unrest deepens, Hong Kongers eye exit strategies,REUTERS,September,13,2019": "HONG KONG/MELBOURNE/VANCOUVER--As protests in Hong Kong stretch from summer into autumn with little sign of resolution, a surge in migration applications suggests more locals are making plans to leave the special administrative region.Their sentiments, reflected in passport paperwork and in interviews with residents, migration agents and real estate brokers across the globe, show the potential for human and capital flight out of Hong Kong.Since an abortive push to allow extradition to mainland China sparked unrest in the former British colony three months ago, emigration seminars have been overflowing, organizers and attendees say.Requests for police-record printouts, which cost HK$225 ($29 or 3,137 yen) and are only issued for visa applications or child adoptions, jumped 54 percent to 3,649 in August compared with last year. There have been more requests in 2019 so far than at the same point in any of the previous five years.In 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 75 adoptions in Hong Kong, a number comparable to previous years. The Hong Kong government estimates that last year about 7,600 people left the city for good, roughly one-third the number who sought police-record printouts.Authorities in Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan have reported spikes in migration inquiries, and property agents from Melbourne to Vancouver say their phones are running hot.\"There are many uncertainties in Hong Kong,\" one investor on a property agent's late-August tour of suburban Melbourne said before, laying out A$600,000 ($410,000) for a house-and-land package.\"People like me in their 40s and 50s--we think about our child,\" said the investor, who gave only her family name, Lee, because her employer forbids speaking to the media.\"We want a back-up home, a better place to live,\" she added. \"At least if something bad happens, they have a back-up plan, an exit plan.\"And she is not alone: Lee's sentiments were echoed in interviews with 10 other families or individuals considering emigrating.China has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and the Hong Kong government has sought to head off further trouble by accepting one of the protesters' demands and withdrawing the extradition bill.A mass march scheduled for Sunday will test how far that has allayed public anger.As Hong Kong's protests have expanded during the summer, swelling to million-strong marches and calls for democracy, so too have Hong Kongers' searches for safe havens.In June, lawyers and bankers told Reuters that wealthy tycoons were shifting their fortunes to places like Singapore.Now, migration agents say, middle-class families are checking out cheaper alternatives.\"The numbers are the highest in recent years, even higher than 2014,\" said Peggy Lau, a sales director at Uni Immigration Consultancy in Hong Kong, where inquiries have surged sevenfold since protests began in June.To be sure, there is no official data tracking emigration applications from Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7 million. Nor is there evidence of departures or cash outflows on the scale of those in the aftermath of the 1997 handover from Britain to China.But there are firm signs of preparations.Favored destinations such as Malaysia, which is relatively cheap, and Taiwan, which is culturally similar to Hong Kong, show sharp rises in interest.At Johor, near Malaysia's southern tip, property consultant Bruce Lee said Hong Kongers have poured into a project called Forest City, developed by China's Country Garden Holdings Co., Ltd., buying 800 units since June.That compares with 200 units purchased between then and 2016, when sales began.The number of visas issued to Hong Kongers in Taiwan in June and July was 38 percent higher, at 884, than in the same period a year ago, according to the island's Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency.Inquiries by Hong Kongers at Immigration@SG LLP, an immigration consultancy in Singapore, rose by roughly a quarter in the past two months compared with earlier in the year, said a company spokesman, Muhammad Ryhan.State authorities in Australia have noted a \"significant\" increase in visa inquiries from Hong Kong, but declined to give details. Immigration agents have said there is also growing interest in Canada, the United States and Ireland.In New Zealand, the number of monthly applicants for residency visas from Hong Kong passport holders hit 34 in June and 44 in July, modestly higher than the average of 29.There are signs that property investors are laying the groundwork for a move as well.Hong Kong's famously frothy real estate market, worth $1.3 trillion, is shrinking, with prices edging lower for a second consecutive month in July and transaction volumes forecast to hit a six-month low.Peter Wong, a property agent in Sydney, has taken a half-dozen calls from Hong Kong buyers in the last month, the first he can remember in decades. Some agents have also reported sudden interest in Taiwan and Vancouver.There are no signs yet of an effect on prices in destination markets, but demand is strong enough that agents and developers say they have begun actively courting Hong Kongers.\"We see there is an opportunity,\" said Ken Dodds, sales director at Melbourne homebuilder Resimax, which hosted 43 Hong Kong investors last month, after previously focusing on buyers from Malaysia and Singapore.\"People are keen to look for a safe haven,\" he said, adding that the investors bought or reserved a dozen properties, which he described as a \"great\" result.It is a trend some in the market expect to continue.\"This episode has planted a seed in many Hong Kongers with Canadian ties to begin the process of moving money, assets, and family out of Hong Kong and back to Canada,\" Dan Scarrow, president of Vancouver-based Macdonald Realty told Reuters.\"This process will play out over the coming years, not over the coming weeks,\" he said.", "Belting out karaoke new protest method in Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of Hong Kong people belted out a new protest song in karaoke-style at shopping malls in the latest act of resistance that highlighted the creativity of demonstrators in their months-long fight for democratic freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.Late Wednesday, activists and ordinary citizens sang \"Glory to Hong Kong\" at several malls for a third straight night in a respite from recent violence clashes. More protests are expected this weekend, though on Thursday police banned one planned rally, citing safety concerns.The protesters have adopted the song, penned anonymously, as their anthem. The lyrics reflect protesters' vow not to surrender despite a government concession to ax an extradition bill that sparked the summer of unrest.At the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin district, some 2,000 people spread across several floors chanted slogans before breaking out into song in an emotional scene, with some crying with their hands to their hearts while others lifted their hands in the air. Many referred to lyrics on their phone as they sang a cappella.The crowd included families with young children, students and senior citizens, many of them not wearing masks, the usual attire of protesters. The busy mall is linked to a subway station where police fired tear gas on Sunday after protesters vandalized the station.Local media showed singing taking place in at least four other malls, as well as in some spots including outside a subway station. The South China Morning Post said participants responded to online calls to gather and sing. Police were absent and the gatherings dispersed peacefully.The song has been sung at almost every protest since it emerged Aug. 31, including during a World Cup qualifier match on Tuesday with Iran where Hong Kong soccer fans booed at the Chinese national anthem before kick-off.The sing-alongs have boosted protesters' morale and highlighted their creativity in inventing new ways to get their message heard by the authorities.On Thursday, hundreds of pro-Beijing supporters staged a counter protest during lunchtime at a swank mall downtown, singing the Chinese national anthem and waving red five-star national flags.Protesters have widened their demands to include calls for direct elections for the city's leaders and police accountability. Many saw the extradition bill, that would have sent some suspected criminals to China for trial, as a glaring example of the city's eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several massive rallies, said Thursday it is appealing the police ban on its planned march Sunday.Police had also banned the group's Aug. 31 march but protesters turned up anyway. Violent clashes erupted that night, with police storming a subway car and hitting passengers with batons and pepper spray.Front coordinator Bonnie Leung said police noted the proposed route would pass close to high-risk buildings including the police headquarters, government offices and subway stations that have been a focus of protests in recent weeks.She said police also told the group they cannot stop protesters from breaking away and carrying out illegal violent acts. But Leung said violent clashes were unrelated to the group.\"We create a safe zone for people to protest. Our marches are like Hong Kong people giving a chance to the government to end the crisis peacefully but now, they have closed the valve to release public anger. It's like declaring war to peaceful protesters,\" she told the Associated Press.Leung accused authorities of trying to provoke protesters to carry out illegal gatherings to find an excuse to crack down. She urged activists \"not to fall into the trap,\" saying protests can be in many forms and that they should keep safe to sustain the protest movement.", "Mid-Autumn Festival lantern protests to light up Hong Kong,REUTERS,September,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activists will combine anti-government protests with lantern celebrations marking the Mid-Autumn Festival this weekend after a brief lull in sometimes violent demonstrations that have rocked the Chinese-ruled city since June.The protests include another in a series of \"stress tests\" of the airport, which in recent weeks have seen approach roads blocked, street fires started and the trashing of a nearby MTR subway station.Protesters also jammed the airport arrivals hall last month, leading to canceled or delayed flights and clashes with police.The Mid-Autumn Festival is a harvest celebration throughout the Chinese-speaking world and in East and Southeast Asia. It is celebrated with mooncakes, gazing at the full moon and colorful lantern displays and falls on Friday this year.Protesters plan a series of lantern-carrying human chains and sit-ins at MTR shopping malls and on the city's scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.There were brief scuffles, pushing and hair pulling, between pro-Beijing and anti-Hong Kong government supporters in the mall of the IFC, a prominent skyscraper on the newly reclaimed Central waterfront. Some top-brand stores were closed.Police denied the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) permission for a mass downtown march on Sunday.\"In previous marches applied for by CHRF, participants, reporters and police suffered serious injuries,\" police said in their refusal letter to the group.\"Some protesters acted violently and blocked the main road and even used petrol bombs, bricks and iron bars to damage public facilities and social peace.\"The group has appealed.Police have responded to violence with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannon and baton charges, prompting complaints of excessive force.Protesters also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to make sure China honors the Sino-British Joint Declaration which was signed in 1984, laying out the former British colony's future.China says Hong Kong is now its internal affair.

A deal with Hong Kong would be contingent on that deal being abandoned.Hong Kong exchange CEO Charles Li acknowledged the company was coming late with its offer, but hoped to win over the London firm in a \"corporate Romeo and Juliet\" story.Refinitiv's appeal is its data, viewed as a lucrative new business operation that would help the London exchange move on from being a simple trading platform.In Hong Kong's favor is that a deal in Asia would give the London exchange, which also owns the Milan bourse and the Russell Indexes in the United States, access to a new market whenever it leaves the EU. As things stand, Britain is due to leave the EU, which it has been a part of for 46 years and with which it has extensive and deep economic ties, on Oct. 31.If it leaves without a divorce deal, then tariffs and more red tape will be imposed on trade with the other 27 European Union countries. Financial services are a big part of the British economy and a no-deal Brexit will lead to a period of disruption, at least in the short-term.Britain's pro-Brexit government has proclaimed its desire to turn to markets beyond Europe to shore up business and London's role as a financial hub, so a deal in Asia for the London exchange could be viewed as an asset.\"A combined group will be strongly placed to benefit from the dynamic and evolving macroeconomic landscape, whilst enhancing the long-term resilience and relevance of London and Hong Kong as global financial centers,\" Li argued.For the Hong Kong exchange, the potential deal has been made cheaper by the 20 percent-or-so fall in the pound in the wake of the country's 2016 decision to leave the EU. The currency this summer trended down toward its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, effectively making British companies cheaper. That's certainly the case for companies in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.For the Hong Kong exchange, the deal could help it diversify at a time of tensions in the city over the Chinese government's influence. Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong after Beijing's attempts to exert greater control have created uncertainty over the city's role as an international business hub.But the protests, if anything, could harden opposition by the London exchange, its shareholders or British authorities.\"There is a very high bar to clear in order for this to succeed,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.", "Hong Kong protesters hit pause to mark Sept. 11 attacks,REUTERS,September,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activists called off protests on Wednesday in remembrance of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and denounced a Chinese state newspaper report that they were planning \"massive terror\" in the Chinese-ruled city.Hong Kong has been rocked by months of sometimes violent unrest, prompted by anger over planned legislation that would have allowed extraditions to China but broadening into calls for democracy and for Communist Party rulers in Beijing to leave the city alone.\"Anti-government fanatics are planning massive terror attacks, including blowing up gas pipes, in Hong Kong on September 11,\" the Hong Kong edition of the China Daily said on its Facebook page on Tuesday alongside a picture of the attacks on the twin towers in New York.\"The 9/11 terror plot also encourages indiscriminate attacks on non-native speakers of Cantonese and starting mountain fires,\" it said.

The government promised last week to withdraw the bill but that failed to placate the protesters, whose demands now include democratic reforms and police accountability.Security at the Hong Kong Stadium was tight, with fans frisked to ensure they did not bring in political materials and other prohibited items. Iran, Asia's top team, had sought to move the match, citing safety concerns over the unrest, but the request was rejected by FIFA, soccer's governing body.Stadium announcers said 14,000 spectators attended the game.Iran beat Hong Kong 2-0.\"Hong Kong people are united. We will speak up for freedom and democracy,\" one of the spectators, Leo Fan, said as members of the crowd continued to chant slogans and sing protest songs as they left.In July, Hong Kong fans chanted slogans and waved banners when English Premier League champions Manchester City played local team Kitchee at the stadium.Many see the extradition bill as a glaring example of the city's eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997. Clashes have become increasingly violent, with police firing tear gas after protesters vandalized subway stations, set street fires and blocked traffic over the weekend.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam renewed an appeal to protesters earlier Tuesday to \"say no to violence\" and engage in dialogue, as the city's richest man urged the government to provide a way out for the mostly young demonstrators.Lam said the escalation of violence, in which more than 150 people including students have been detained in clashes since Friday, will deepen rifts and prolong the road to recovery.She said her decision to formally withdraw the extradition bill and her other initiatives reflected her sincerity to heal society by initiating a direct dialogue with various communities, including protesters.Billionaire Li Ka Shing, in a video broadcast on local TV, described the summer of unrest as the worst catastrophe since World War II. In his first public comments, Li called youths the \"masters of our future\" and said the government should temper justice with mercy in resolving the crisis.\"I am very worried. We hope Hong Kong people will be able to ride out the storm. We hope the young people can consider the big picture and those at the helm can give the masters of our future a way out,\" Li, 91, told a religious gathering outside a Buddhist temple over the weekend.Asked about Li's comments, Lam agreed that the government \"can do more and can do better\" especially in meeting young people to hear their grievances.But she stressed the government cannot condone violence and will strictly enforce the law.The unrest has become the biggest challenge to Beijing's rule since it took over Hong Kong and is an embarrassment to its ruling Communist Party ahead of Oct. 1 celebrations of its 70th year in power. Beijing has slammed the protests as an effort by criminals to split the territory from China, backed by what it said were hostile foreigners.Beijing rebuked Germany on Tuesday for allowing prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong to visit \"to engage in anti-China separatist activities.\"Wong met Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Berlin late Monday at an event hosted by the German newspaper Bild.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Maas' \"political show\" with Wong displayed disrespect to China's sovereignty and was an interference in its internal affairs. She urged Germany to avoid sending the wrong signal to \"radical, separatist forces in Hong Kong\" and said any efforts to solicit foreign support to split the country are \"doomed to fail.\"In an immediate response, Wong tweeted that Chinese 's strong reaction was \"baffling.\"Wong, a leader of Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protest movement, was charged last month with inciting people to join a protest in June.

activists with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just returned from a trip to China, during which she faced criticism from Germany for not

anti-government protesters after another weekend of clashes in the Chinese-ruled city.Metro stations reopened after some were closed on Sunday amid sometimes violent confrontations, although the mood in the Asian financial hub remained tense.Early on Monday, before school started, rows of students and alumni joined hands chanting \"Hong Kong people, add oil,\" a phrase which has become a rallying

the government and greater calls for democracy.The former British colony is facing its first recession in a decade as the protests scare off tourists and bite into retail sales in one of the world's most popular shopping destinations.Tourist arrivals plunged 40 percent in August year on year, said Paul Chan, the city's finance secretary, with sustained clashes leading to main roads being shrouded in teargas and blocked, and the international airport shut down--hitting the tourism, retail and hotel industries.\"The most worrying thing is that the road ahead is not easily going to turn any better,\" Chan said in his blog on Sunday, noting that some hotels had seen room rates plunge up to 70 percent.Activists started fires in the street and vandalized a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in the main business district of Central on Sunday after thousands rallied peacefully at the U.S. consulate, calling for help in bringing democracy to the special administrative region.The students, brandishing posters with the protesters' five demands for the government, called on authorities to respond to the promises of freedom, human rights and rule of law.University students were also expected to join the human chain protests during the day on their campuses.One of the five demands--to formally withdraw the extradition bill--was announced last week by the city government leader, Carrie Lam, but protesters are angry about her failure to call an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality during demonstrations.The protesters' other demands include the retraction of the word \"riot\" to describe demonstrations, the release of all those arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.In a rare public appearance, Lam walked around the central business district with the city's Transport and Housing Secretary Frank Chan and MTR officials to inspect the damaged station, where she chatted with staff and commuters.Dressed in a black suit, she examined electronic ticketing machines and boarded up windows smashed the previous day, the public broadcaster RTHK showed.Following the demonstration at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, Hong

It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.Chinese state media on Monday said Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China and any form of secessionism \"will be crushed.\"The China Daily newspaper said Sunday's rally was proof foreign forces were behind the protests and warned demonstrators should \"stop trying the patience of the central government.\"Young pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was released from police custody on Monday after breaching bail conditions following his arrest in August when he was charged along with a number of other prominent activists for inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was monitoring events in Hong Kong.\"The freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong, and those freedoms must be vigorously protected.

Beijing and the entirely state-controlled media have portrayed the protests as an effort by criminals to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.Protesters on Sunday urged Washington to pass a bill, known as the Hong Kong Democratic and Human Rights Act, to support their cause. The bill proposes sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials found to suppress democracy and human rights in the city, and could also affect Hong Kong's preferential trade status with the U.S.A group of protesters sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before handing over an appeal letter to a U.S. Consulate official.Just before the rally ended, violence erupted after riot police detained several people and cleared a crowd from the nearby Central subway station. Angry protesters smashed glass windows, sprayed graffiti and started a fire at one at the station's exits.The government said protesters also set street fires and blocked traffic at some thoroughfares. In the type of cat-and-mouse battle that has characterized the summer-long protests, riot police pursued groups of protesters down streets, but they kept regrouping.Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas in the Causeway Bay shopping area after protesters heckled them and refused to leave. They also searched dozens of young people on the street and inside subway stations.At the Mong Kok police station, clashes took place for a third straight night. Police fired projectiles at an angry crowd that was shining laser beams, and several people were detained.The U.S. State Department said in a travel advisory Friday that Beijing has undertaken a propaganda campaign \"falsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong.\" It said U.S. citizens and embassy staff were targeted and urged them to exercise increased caution.Some American legislators are pressing Trump to take a tougher stand on Hong Kong. But the president has suggested that it's a matter for China to handle, though he also has said that no violence should be used. Political analysts suggest that Trump's response has been muted because he doesn't want to disrupt talks with China over their tariff war.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday that Hong Kong residents deserve real autonomy and freedom from fear. She urged an end to police violence against protesters and said Congress looks forward to \"swiftly advancing\" the Hong Kong bill.The protests are an embarrassment to China's ruling Communist Party ahead of the Oct. 1 celebration of its 70th anniversary in power.Separately, well-known Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong said in a statement through his lawyer that he was detained at the city's airport early Friday for breaching bail conditions. Wong, a leader of Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protest movement, was among several people detained last month and was charged with inciting people to join a protest in June.Wong had just returned from Taiwan, where he gave speeches on Hong Kong's protests, and is due to visit Germany and the U.S. He said a court had approved his overseas trips.He described his detention as a procedural hiccup and said he expected to be released Monday.

Violent arrests of protesters have drawn international attention.Police on Saturday searched bags of people on buses and trains headed to the airport where police and press outnumbered passengers.

She will dine with President Xi Jinping in the evening.The German leader faces the challenge of balancing human rights concerns and economic discussions with one of Germany's largest trading partners.\"I indicated during the talks that the rights and freedoms agreed upon in Hong Kong's Basic Law should be safeguarded,\" Merkel said during a joint news briefing with Li. The Basic Law is Hong Kong's de facto constitution, which promises the semi-autonomous Chinese city certain democratic rights not afforded to the mainland.Merkel added that political dialogue--not violence--is the path toward a resolution.China was Germany's biggest single trading partner last year, with trade totaling 199 billion euros ($218 billion). The relationship is important to Europe's largest economy, particularly as Germany is considered likely to enter a technical recession in the current quarter.Germany long had amicable relations with Beijing because its exporters ran a surplus supplying Chinese factories with equipment and components. But those ties increasingly are strained over German complaints about market access and Chinese technology policy.Li told reporters during the joint briefing that German companies are welcome in China and will have a relatively easier time getting things approved because the two countries have a foundation of trust. He and Merkel discussed collaboration on artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles, as well as intellectual property rights and reducing export controls, Li said.Beijing has previously tried without success to recruit Germany as an ally in its tariff war with President Donald Trump. While Merkel's government has echoed U.S. complaints, it objects to Trump's tactics, which he has also used against Europe.US-China trade tensions have also impacted German businesses, Merkel said, adding that China and Germany hope to serve as models for defending multilateral trade relationships.Merkel is in Beijing with a high-ranking German business delegation that includes executives in the auto, financial services and transport industries. In recent years, German companies have been unhappy about being barred from acquiring most Chinese assets at a time when China's companies have been on a global buying spree.The economic ties make it harder for Merkel to satisfy a U.S. diplomat and activists who have urged her to raise human rights issues such as China's treatment of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as the three months of pro-democracy demonstrations that have roiled Hong Kong.Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Thursday that China's \"willful disregard of its commitments\" to Hong Kong and human rights violations in Xinjiang show that its ruling Communist Party \"stands against the values Germany cherishes.\"\"We hope that Chancellor Merkel will take a firm stance for the values that unified Germany after the fall of Communism: human rights, democracy and the rule of law,\" he said.Hong Kong activists also warned Merkel about dealing with \"authoritarian and unjust regimes\" in an open letter published this week in Germany's Bild newspaper.On the question of what Merkel might say about Hong Kong, a senior German official said the talks with Xi and Li will be conducted \"comprehensively in terms of thematic breadth, and open and friendly in terms of tone--with a readiness to express criticism where we think things are worthy of criticism.\"The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in line with department rules.China has bristled at what it calls foreign interference from countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. on political tumult in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city where activists have staged three months of mass protests calling for democratic reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct.On Friday, Merkel will also visit German engineering company ZF Fredrichshafen in Beijing.

The proposed legislation would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial.Despite the hard-fought concession, some protesters have said they will continue their resistance because the government has committed to fulfilling only one of their five demands, which include electoral reforms and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to China in 1997 under the so-called \"one country, two systems\" framework, which promised the territory certain democratic rights not afforded to the mainland. In recent years, however, some Hong Kong residents have accused Beijing of steadily eroding those freedoms.Students in blue school dresses held hands Friday outside the Maryknoll Convent School, a Catholic girls' school. They paired their uniforms with surgical masks, in the style of protesters who wear masks to conceal their identities and mitigate the effects of tear gas. Alumni from various schools and clad in protesters' trademark black also joined similar chains in the district.One young man dressed in a shirt bearing his school's emblem held up a placard that said \"Freedom.\"The demonstrations that began in June have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, with protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and police officers using tear gas, batons and water cannons.

Its economy has been growing under a judicial system that places great importance on equality among citizens.When Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, Beijing promised a \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach to administration of the city as a gesture of respect for its history.Over time, however, the Chinese government has taken a series of actions that unmistakably reflect Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention to focus only on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country\u00e2\u0080\u009d part of the promise while gradually eroding the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d part of the principle.These actions have been intended as either tangible or intangible pressure on freedom of speech and economic activities in Hong Kong.How the Hong Kong government has responded to the civil disturbance has also made abundantly clear that the local administration is under the Chinese government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unchallengeable control. Many people in Hong Kong fear and reject the prospect of Hong Kong morphing into a society where the Communist Party has the final say on everything.It has been reported that Beijing wants to calm the situation by Oct. 1, when it will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China.Top Chinese government officials have not ruled out the possibility of using armed force or other means for direct intervention in the crisis. But Beijing should immediately stop such high-handed attempts to intimidate Hong Kong protesters.In her speech, Lam also pledged to create a new framework for dialogue with \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople from all walks of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe should immediately start leading the Hong Kong government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to have constructive talks with citizens on how it should respond to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views and opinions and how it should incorporate them into its policy initiatives, including the proposal to introduce a democratic election system.--The Asahi Shimbun, Sept. 6", "Hong Kong braces for weekend protests as leader fails to appease activists,REUTERS,September,6,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong is bracing for more demonstrations this weekend, with protesters threatening to disrupt transport links to the airport as embattled leader Carrie Lam's withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill fails to appease some activists.Protesters plan to block traffic to the city's international airport on Saturday, a week after thousands of demonstrators disrupted transport links, which saw some of the worst violence since the unrest escalated three months ago.The Airport Authority, in an advert in the South China Morning Post newspaper on Friday, urged protesters \"not to disrupt the journey of tens of thousands of travelers who use the airport every day.\"In a pre-recorded televised address on Wednesday, Lam said the extradition bill had been withdrawn, conceding to one of the protesters' five demands, although many said the move was too little, too late.The extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, triggered mass protests that have now evolved into a broader backlash against the Hong Kong government and its political masters in Beijing.The massive and sometimes violent protests present Chinese President Xi Jinping with his greatest popular challenge since he came to power in 2012.Many protesters remain angry over Lam's refusal to grant an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality against protesters.

Healy is managing director of Swire Coca-Cola Ltd.Hong Kong is in its third month of protests that started in opposition to a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for a more democratic system.The territory's chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced Wednesday she was withdrawing the proposed law. She said Hong Kong officials would talk with the public about other possible changes.Beijing earlier warned that Cathay employees who \"support or take part in illegal protests\" would be barred from flying to or over the mainland. Cathay said a pilot who was charged with rioting was removed from flying duties.Slosar said in August that Cathay didn't tell employees what to think, but that shifted following China's warning. Hogg threatened penalties including possible firing if employees took part in \"illegal protests.\"Cathay Pacific serves more than 200 destinations in Asia, Europe and the Americas. It has 33,000 employees. Its parent, Cathay Pacific Group, also owns Dragonair, Air Hong Kong and HK Express.Hong Kong was promised a \"high degree of autonomy\"--a system dubbed \"one country, two systems\" by Beijing--when the former British colony returned to China in 1997.Government critics say that is being eroded by Hong Kong leaders and the Communist Party.", "Asian shares up as Brexit, Hong Kong progress lifts mood,REUTERS,September,5,2019": "Asian stocks perked up on Thursday, as apparent progress in the political crises in Britain and Hong Kong gave investor confidence a shot in the arm, with easing fears of a hard Brexit lifting the battered pound.Sterling held onto gains against the dollar in Asia after rallying by its most in more than five months on Wednesday as lawmakers voted to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.Risk appetite also rose on news that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam was withdrawing an extradition bill that had triggered months of often violent protests in the Asian financial hub.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.24 percent. U.S. Treasury yields extended gains in Asia and the yield curve steepened, both signs that investors were willing to take on riskier assets.Still, there was skepticism over how long the positive mood would last with Britain's divorce from the EU and political unrest in Hong Kong not yet completely resolved.\"In a world of negative news, a bunch of things came together and we had something positive,\" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney.\"We should see some follow through in Asia.

Beijing denies meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, yet it warned again on Tuesday that it would act if protests threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.Pro-Beijing lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan said Lam's announcement was not a compromise to appease those promoting violence but a bid to win over moderates in the protest camp.\"It was likely speaking to the so-called peaceful, rational, non-violent people who were dissatisfied with the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response before,\" he said.The chief executive's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill's withdrawal.Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped after the report of the bill's imminent withdrawal, trading up about 4%.

They argue that it is useless to study if they have no meaningful future to contemplate.An 18-year-old female secondary school student said she felt that Hong Kong was being swallowed up by the mainland as Beijing tries to effectively change the \"one nation, two systems\" agreement that had been promised for 50 years after Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.\"I am fearful for what Hong Kong will turn into when I become an adult,\" she said. \"I will continue with the protest because my future depends on it.\"Another 15-year-old secondary school student said the use of tear gas by police to disperse crowds had turned Hong Kong into a battlefield in recent months.Under the one nation, two systems framework, Hong Kong's educational system differs from the one in mainland China.Many of today's secondary school students were heavily influenced by the so-called umbrella movement that flourished five years ago when young activists called for greater democracy in Hong Kong. Even as Hong Kong authorities tried to instill patriotism in the students, many young people hold mixed feelings toward China.But unlike five years ago, when the movement had a charismatic leader in the form of Joshua Wong, 22, who outlined the democratic changes that were needed, the protesters today lack a strong leader.Now, it appears that those capturing the hearts of the students are the more radical young activists who take their places in the front line, making them the first targets of police trying to break up the rallies.\"We can hold these protests because they are protecting us from the police,\" said one fourth-year secondary school student. \"I would also stand at the forefront if I had more confidence in my physical condition.\"Authorities in recent days have taken stricter measures to regain control.On Sept. 2, the police said they detained 159 people, including minors as young as 13. Since June, more than 1,000 people have been detained.Despite images beamed around the world of swarms of protesters thronging the streets of Hong Kong, it emerges that the vast majority of young students are not that sympathetic to the cause.An 18-year-old sixth-year secondary school student, referring to the controversial extradition measure that sparked the fury, said about 20 percent of his classmates opposed the measure to extradite criminal suspects from Hong Kong to stand trial in China.The student said that about half of his classmates had little or no interest in the issue, while about 30 percent supported the government and police.Some schools in Hong Kong refuse to discipline those who boycott classes, while others strictly prohibit such activity on grounds students should focus on learning.A 50-year-old English teacher said she was taking part in the protest as an individual.Explaining that the school where she worked prohibited class boycotts, the woman said, \"I believe that thinking about society and taking action is a form of learning that cannot be obtained through textbooks.\"Many adults in the protest had children in secondary school.One 45-year-old father said he supported the protests but was concerned about children standing in the front lines of the demonstrations because of the risk of injury.(This article was written by Hideshi Nishimoto and Yuichiro Masumitsu.)", "Zara seeks to distance brand from HK protest controversy,REUTERS,September,3,2019": "BEIJING--Spanish apparel giant Zara, seeking to avoid becoming embroiled in controversy over protests in Hong Kong, issued a statement on Chinese social media late on Monday expressing support for China's sovereignty over the Asian financial hub.Zara made its statement after the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao asked in a headline whether the closure of four of the company's Hong Kong shops on Monday was in support of a strike call by students, a question that was seized upon by mainland social media users.Zara, owned by Inditex, said it supported the \"one country, two systems\" policy under which China rules Hong Kong, and had not supported strikes.It was not immediately clear why Zara closed the stores on Monday, as reported by Ming Pao, although shops in Hong Kong have often shut their doors when protests are taking place nearby.Zara did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.The brand became a top trending topic on China's Weibo social media platform, with one hashtag \"Zara statement\" viewed more than 170 million times as of Tuesday morning.On Monday, thousands of Hong Kong university and school students boycotted class and rallied peacefully for democracy, following a weekend marred by some of the worst violence since unrest escalated more than three months ago.Foreign brands are under increasing pressure from Chinese consumers and regulators to fall into line on contentious issues around Chinese sovereignty and its territorial claims.Last month, a number of Chinese brand ambassadors of fashion labels from Coach to Givenchy severed ties with the companies over products which they said violated China's sovereignty by identifying Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries.Last year, Zara was criticized on Chinese social media for placing Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China sees as a break-away province, in a pull-down list of countries on its Chinese website.", "Hong Kong students plan 2nd day of pro-democracy rallies,REUTERS,September,3,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong school and university students on Tuesday are due to boycott classes and hold pro-democracy rallies for the second straight day, further fueling the political crisis in the Chinese-ruled city.Thousands of students joined demonstrations at universities on Monday, many wearing gas masks, joining hands to form human chains and chanting for Hong Kong to be given greater autonomy from the central Chinese government.The runaway rebellion in Hong Kong is piling pressure on its embattled leader Carrie Lam, who was due to hold a media conference at 9:30 a.m. (0130 GMT).Reuters exclusively reported on Tuesday that Lam told business leaders last week that she had caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by igniting the political crisis by introducing a now-suspended extradition bill which would see people sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.Lam said she would quit if she had a choice, according to a leaked audio recording.

The law has been shelved, but Lam has been unable to end the upheaval. Protesters have expanded their demands to include complete withdrawal of the proposal, a concession her administration has so far refused. Large demonstrations wracked the city again over the weekend.Lam suggested that Beijing had not yet reached a turning point. She said Beijing had not imposed any deadline for ending the crisis ahead of National Day celebrations scheduled for October 1. And she said China had \"absolutely no plan\" to deploy People's Liberation Army troops on Hong Kong streets. World leaders have been closely watching whether China will send in the military to quell the protests, as it did a generation ago in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing.Lam noted, however, that she had few options once an issue had been elevated \"to a national level,\" a reference to the leadership in Beijing, \"to a sort of sovereignty and security level, let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented tension between the two big economies in the world.\"In such a situation, she added, \"the room, the political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people's government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited.\"Three people who attended the meeting confirmed that Lam had made the comments in a talk that lasted about half an hour.

The meeting was one of a number of \"closed-door sessions\" that Lam said she has been doing \"with people from all walks of life\" in Hong Kong.Responding to Reuters, a spokesman for Lam said she attended two events last week that included businesspeople, and that both were effectively private. \"We are therefore not in a position to comment on what the Chief Executive has said at those events,\" the spokesman said.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, a high-level agency under China's cabinet, the State Council, did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters.China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.The Hong Kong protests mark the biggest popular challenge to the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with an escalating strategic rivalry with the United States and a slowing economy. Tensions have risen as the world's two biggest economies are embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war. Disagreements over Taiwan and over China's moves to tighten its control in the South China Sea have further frayed relations between Beijing and Washington.Lam's remarks are consistent with a Reuters report published on Friday that revealed how leaders in Beijing are effectively calling the shots on handling the crisis in Hong Kong. The Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Asked about the report, China's Foreign Ministry said that the central government \"supports, respects and understands\" Lam's decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, denounced it as \"fake.\"As protests escalated, Lam suspended the bill on June 15. Several weeks later, on July 9, she announced that it was \"dead.\" That failed to mollify the protesters, who expanded their demands to include an inquiry into police violence and democratic reform. Many have also called for an end to what they see as meddling by Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong.The tone of Lam's comments in the recording is at odds with her more steely public visage. At times, she can be heard choking up as she reveals the personal impact of the three-month crisis.\"For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,\" she said.Lam told the meeting that the leadership in Beijing was aware of the potential damage to China's reputation that would arise from sending troops into Hong Kong to quell the protests.\"They know that the price would be too huge to pay,\" she said.\"They care about the country's international profile,\" she said. \"It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile and to have some say, not only being a big economy but a responsible big economy, so to forsake all those positive developments is clearly not on their agenda.\"But she said China was \"willing to play long\" to ride out the unrest, even if it meant economic pain for the city, including a drop in tourism and losing out on capital inflows such as initial public offerings.Lam also spoke about the importance of the rule of law in Hong Kong and restoring stability to the city of more than seven million, as well as the need to improve efforts to get the government's message out. At the end, applause can be heard on the recording.While Lam said that now was not the time for \"self-pity,\" she spoke about her profound frustration with not being able \"to reduce the pressure on my frontline police officers,\" or to provide a political solution to \"pacify the large number of peaceful protesters who are so angry with the government, with me in particular.\"Her inability \"to offer a political situation in order to relieve the tension,\" she said, was the source of her \"biggest sadness.\"Lam also spoke about the impact the crisis has had on her daily life.\"Nowadays it is extremely difficult for me to go out,\" she said. \"I have not been on the streets, not in shopping malls, can't go to a hair salon. I can't do anything because my whereabouts will be spread around social media.\"If she were to appear in public, she said, \"you could expect a big crowd of black T-shirts and black-masked young people waiting for me.\" Many of the protesters wear black at demonstrations.After enjoying relatively high popularity in the initial part of her tenure, Lam is now the least popular of any of the four leaders who have run Hong Kong since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, according to veteran pollster Robert Chung, who runs the Public Opinion Research Institute.Lam was chosen as city leader in March 2017, vowing to \"unite society\" and heal divisions in Hong Kong, which remains by far the freest city under Chinese rule. Under the \"one country, two systems\" formula agreed with Britain, Hong Kong enjoys an array of personal freedoms that don't exist in mainland China. One of the most cherished of those freedoms is the city's British-style system of independent courts and rule of law. The protesters say the extradition law would erode that bulwark of liberty.According to a biography on the Hong Kong government website, Lam, a devout Catholic, attended St Francis' Canossian College. Her mother, who took care of seven family members on a daily basis, was her role model and inspiration, the biography said. An election manifesto said Lam came from a \"grassroots\" family and did her homework on a bunk-bed. After studying sociology at the University of Hong Kong, she went on to a distinguished career as a civil servant in Hong Kong. She was elected city leader in March 2017 by a 1,200-member election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists.In her early days as leader, Lam pushed through a series of controversial government policies, drawing public criticism in Hong Kong but winning praise from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.On July 1, 2017, the day she was sworn in, Lam donned a white hard hat as she walked with Xi to inspect the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which physically links Hong Kong to mainland China. Critics say the bridge could further weaken Hong Kong's autonomy by deepening its physical links with southern China.The effective expulsion last year of Financial Times editor Victor Mallet, whose visa wasn't renewed after he hosted an event at the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club with the leader of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, also drew condemnation at home and abroad. Lam and her government later came under fire for banning the party and the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers.Xi praised Lam's leadership during a visit to Beijing in December 2018. \"The central government fully endorses the work of Chief Executive Lam\" and the Hong Kong government, Xi said, according to a report in the state news agency Xinhua.Pollster Robert Chung said Lam's success in pushing through many controversial proposals bolstered her belief she would be able to ram through the extradition bill.\"All these things made her feel so confident, and when we had the first demonstration, she still thought, 'Don't worry, I'll get it through in two days and things will be over,'\" Chung said. \"But she was totally wrong.\"At the meeting last week, Lam said the extradition bill was her doing and was meant to \"plug legal loopholes in Hong Kong's system.\"\"This is not something instructed, coerced by the central government,\" she said.She expressed deep regrets about her push to pass the bill. \"This has proven to be very unwise given the circumstances,\" she said. \"And this huge degree of fear and anxiety amongst people of Hong Kong vis--vis the mainland of China, which we were not sensitive enough to feel and grasp.\"She gave her audience a gloomy outlook. The police, she said, would continue to arrest those responsible for \"this escalating violence,\" a group that the government initially estimated numbered between one thousand and two thousand.It would be \"naive,\" she said, to \"paint you a rosy picture, that things will be fine.\" She did, however, express hope in the city's ultimate \"resurrection.\"\"Hong Kong is not dead yet. Maybe she is very, very sick, but she is not dead yet,\" she said.", "Hong Kong students plan to strike as trains disrupted,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,2,2019": "HONG KONG--On the first day of school Monday, secondary students in Hong Kong supplemented their formal white uniforms with gas masks, goggles and hard hats as they planned to strike in a show of continued commitment to a fiery anti-government protest movement.The semiautonomous Chinese territory has been rocked by nearly three months of pro-democracy protests calling for electoral reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct.The youth-dominated demonstrations will be tested as classes resume and many protesters are expected to go back to school following the summer break. A strike was scheduled for Monday afternoon for student protesters to skip classes and congregate at a public square in central Hong Kong.At St. Francis' Canossian College, a girls' school, uniformed students knelt in a line and held up hand-painted signs that read: \"The five major demands: Not one is dispensable.\"The protesters' demands include dropping charges against demonstrators who have been arrested and formally withdrawing an extradition bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial.Some demonstrators disrupted the morning commute by blocking train doors, attempting to evade riot police who were hot on their heels by moving quickly between multiple public transit stations.Officers at Lok Fu station hit protesters with batons and arrested one. Another three were arrested at Lai King station.On Sunday, the MTR Corp. suspended train service to the airport after several hundred protesters gathered there following calls online to disrupt transportation. They blocked buses arriving at the airport but police in riot helmets kept them out of the terminal.The protesters accuse Beijing and the government of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam of eroding the autonomy and civil liberties promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.", "Yen rises, yuan pares losses as Sino-U.S. tariffs kick in,REUTERS,September,2,2019": "The yen strengthened on Monday, thanks to bigger appetites for safe-haven assets as Washington and Beijing put additional tariffs on each other's exports, adding to the gloom hanging over the global economic outlook.Gold, which tends to be bought with the yen during times of economic uncertainty, also rose on Monday by the most in almost a week as investors were drawn to so-called risk-off trades.The offshore yuan initially fell during trading but pared its losses after a private survey on Chinese manufacturing in August beat market expectations.Declines in Asian shares on Monday offered more evidence that traders were steering from risk, which is likely to be an important factor behind currency market swings in coming weeks.\"There are a lot of risk events this week from U.S. and Chinese economic data, which should help us see who is hurting more from the trade war, but we don't think a solution is imminent,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.The yen rose around 0.1 percent versus the dollar to 106.15 in Asian trading.The Japanese currency rose around 0.2 percent to 71.43 versus the Australian dollar and advanced around 0.2 percent to 66.88 per New Zealand dollar.Spot gold rose 0.29 percent to $1,524.05 per ounce.In the onshore Chinese market, the yuan traded at 7.1611 per dollar, versus its previous close of 7.1580.In the offshore market, the yuan initially fell versus the dollar but managed to trim its losses to trade at 7.1686 yuan per dollar, down around 0.1 percent.China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in August as production edged up, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed on Monday, but orders remained weak, suggesting sentiment is likely to remain fragile.The United States slapped 15 percent tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday--including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions--while China imposed new duties on U.S. crude oil.Data coming this week includes a survey on Chinese services and August trade numbers on Sunday. There will be manufacturing and services surveys for the United States, which will also release data on its trade balance and non-farm payrolls.U.S. President Donald Trump said the sides would still meet for talks later this month, but hopes for a resolution to the trade war have diminished.Foreign-exchange trading could be subdued on Monday as U.S. financial markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday.The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed on Monday at 98.821.Risk sentiment could also take a hit due to ongoing protests in Hong Kong over China's rule of the city.Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw attention to their fight for democracy.The euro stood at $1.0991, unchanged in Asia, but sentiment for the common currency was weak after it tumbled on Friday to the lowest in more than two years.German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and her coalition partners held off a surge in far right support in two state elections in eastern Germany on Sunday.The result averted an immediate political crisis in Europe's largest economy, but expectations are high that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates at its next monetary policy meeting on Sept. 12, which could weigh on the euro.Sterling traded at $1.2158, down 0.07 percent so far on the day.", "Hong Kong protesters disrupt airport but planes still taking off,REUTERS,September,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Hong Kong airport on Sunday, disrupting travel to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which facing its biggest political crisis in decades.Passengers continued to enter and leave the terminal freely, as clouds hung low overhead, and planes were still taking off and landing.Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.Trains to the airport were suspended on Sunday as protesters urged the public to overwhelm road links to one of the world's busiest and most efficient airports, built on reclaimed land around a tiny outlying island and reached by a series of bridges.The protesters left the airport in the early evening and thousands were on the road heading for the nearby new town of Tung Chung.\"We plan to disrupt activity at the airport to draw attention to what the government and the police are doing to us,\" said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.\"If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong.\"Some observers have suggested targeting the airport could lose the protesters public support.Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track.Sunday's demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing was planning to erode the autonomy granted to the former British colony when it was handed back to China in 1997.China denies the charge of meddling in Hong Kong, which it says is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting \"God save the Queen\".During a chaotic night of violence into the early hours of Sunday, police fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets and protesters threw petrol bombs.As government helicopters hovered overhead, protesters who had been banned from demonstrating set fires in the streets and threw bricks at police near government offices and Chinese military headquarters.Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas.Police said they arrested 40 people inside Prince Edward metro station on suspicion of obstructing officers, unlawful assembly and criminal damage. Three stations stayed shut on Sunday.Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.\"Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,\" it said.The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China's decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.The unrest began in mid-June, fueled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.Hong Kong returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, such as the right to protest and an independent legal system.The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012, with his government keen to end the protests before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China on Oct 1.", "Hong Kong police storm subway with batons as protests rage,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters in Hong Kong threw gasoline bombs at government headquarters and set fires in the streets, while police stormed a subway car and hit passengers with batons and pepper spray in scenes that seem certain to inflame tensions further in a city riven by nearly three months of pro-democracy demonstrations.Police had denied permission for a march Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of a decision by China against fully democratic elections in Hong Kong, but protesters took to the streets anyway, as they have all summer. They provoked and obstructed police repeatedly but generally retreated once riot officers moved in, avoiding some of the direct clashes that characterized earlier protests.Late at night, though, video from Hong Kong broadcaster TVB showed police on the platform of Prince Edward subway station swinging batons at passengers who backed into one end of a train car behind umbrellas. The video also shows pepper spray being shot through an open door at a group seated on the floor while one man holds up his hands.It wasn't clear whether all the passengers were protesters. Police said they entered the station to make arrests after protesters assaulted others and damaged property inside. The TVB video was widely shared on social media as another example of police brutality during the protests. Angry crowds gathered outside Prince Edward and nearby Mong Kok station, where police said they made arrests after protesters vandalized the customer service center and damaged ticket machines.Also Saturday, two police officers fired two warning shots into the air \"to protect their own safety\" after being surrounded by protesters near Victoria Park, the government announced. It was the second time police fired warning shots following an incident the previous weekend.Protests erupted in early June in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory of 7.4 million people. A now-shelved China extradition bill brought to the fore simmering concerns about what many in the city see as an erosion of the rights and freedoms that residents are supposed to have under a \"one country, two systems\" framework.The mostly young, black-shirted protesters took over roads and major intersections in shopping districts on Saturday as they rallied and marched with no obvious destination in mind.Authorities closed streets and a subway stop near the Chinese government office and parked water cannon trucks and erected additional barriers nearby, fearing protesters might target the building. The office would have been the endpoint of the march that police did not allow.Instead, a group of hard-line protesters decided to take on police guarding government headquarters from behind large barriers that ring the building to keep demonstrators at bay.While others marched back and forth nearby, a large crowd wearing helmets and gas masks gathered outside. They pointed laser beams at the officers' heads and threw objects over the barriers and at them. Police responded with tear gas, and protesters threw gasoline bombs into the compound.Then came the blue water. A water cannon truck fired regular water, followed by repeated bursts of colored water, staining protesters and nearby journalists and leaving blue puddles in the street.The standoff continued for some time, but protesters started moving back as word spread that police were headed in their direction. A few front-line protesters hurled gasoline bombs at the officers in formation, but there were no major clashes as police cleared the area.Protesters regrouped and blocked a major commercial street by piling up barricades and setting a large fire. Smoke billowed into the air as hundreds of protesters waited on the other side of the makeshift barrier, many pointing laser beams that streaked the night sky above them.Firefighters made their way into the congested area on foot to put out the fire. Police in riot gear removed the barricades and moved in quickly. They could be seen detaining a few protesters, but by then, most had already left.As police advanced east down Hennessey Road, protesters made another stand in the Causeway Bay shopping district. They threw gasoline bombs at police, who fired tear gas and water cannons.Protesters built another fire, a smaller one, in front of Sogo department store. Police waited behind their riot shields while firefighters put out the smoldering fire with extinguishers. When police moved in, the protesters had again retreated.Other groups crossed Hong Kong's harbor to the Tsim Sha Tsui district, where police said they set fires and threw gasoline bombs on Nathan Road.Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said Hong Kong citizens would keep fighting for their rights and freedoms despite the arrests of several prominent activists and lawmakers in the past two days, including activist Joshua Wong.Protesters are demanding the full withdrawal of the extradition bill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as democratic elections and an investigation into police use of force.\"I do believe the government deliberately arrested several leaders of the democratic camp to try to threaten Hong Kong people not to come out to fight against the evil law,\" Lam said at what was advertised as a Christian march earlier Saturday.About 1,000 people marched to a Methodist church and police headquarters. They alternated between singing hymns and chanting slogans of the pro-democracy movement. An online flyer for the demonstration called it a \"prayer for sinners\" and featured images of a Christian cross and embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who had proposed the extradition bill.The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of pro-democracy marches that have drawn upward of a million people this summer, canceled its march after failing to win police approval. Police said that while previous marches have started peacefully, they have increasingly degenerated into violence.The standing committee of China's legislature ruled on Aug. 31, 2014, that Hong Kong residents could elect their leader directly, but that the candidates would have to be approved by a nominating committee. The decision failed to satisfy democracy advocates in Hong Kong and led to the 79-day long Occupy Central protests that fall, in which demonstrators camped out on major streets in the financial district and other parts of the city.", "Be like water: Hong Kong protesters meander on the march,REUTERS,August,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands marched in a meandering tour of downtown Hong Kong on Saturday in the pouring rain, the latest in a series of anti-government protests that have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its worst political crisis in decades.Police blocked plans for a mass show of force downtown to mark the fifth anniversary of a decision by China to curtail democratic reforms in the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997.People took to the streets anyway, many joining a \"Christian march\" from the Wanchai entertainment district in a sea of umbrellas, heading to government offices on the lower reaches of the Mid-Levels residential district.Others, many wearing black and face masks, marched in the Causeway Bay shopping district, the latest in a string of protests over three months. Some rallies have turned violent, targeting the airport, the legislature and the Liaison Office, the symbol of Chinese rule.\"Hong Kong has religious freedom,\" Sally Yeung, 27, a Christian, told Reuters. \"We are praying at different check points and praying for justice to arrive in Hong Kong.\"If they prosecute us simply because we are praying, they infringe our religious freedom.\"Hovering under an umbrella outside the government offices, Eric, a 22-year-old student, said, \"Telling us not to protest is like telling us not to breathe. I feel it's my duty to fight for democracy. Maybe we win, maybe we lose. But we fight.\"Police erected water-filled plastic barriers around key government buildings and two water cannon, used briefly for the first time last weekend, were parked near the Liaison Office, which was daubed with graffiti in an earlier protest.The MTR subway suspended some services and shut station exits because of likely \"public activities\".Police arrested a number of prominent pro-democracy activists on Friday, seeking to rein in a movement which started with anger over planned legislation allowing extraditions to mainland China and broadened into calls for democracy amid fears China is squeezing Hong Kong's freedoms.But the latest protests have no leaders. The slogan is \"be like water\", meaning be flexible. Marchers on Saturday were marching here and there, wherever streets took them, communicating with different hand signals and chanting \"stand with Hong Kong\" and \"fight for freedom\".Some said road blocks were forcing marchers to splinter.China denies the charge of meddling in Hong Kong, which it says is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.Beijing has also accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the demonstrations and warned against foreign interference.There have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force.\"A lot of people from the outside think it is the police who escalate (the violence) first,\" a police officer told a media briefing. \"This is not true.\"An off-duty policeman was attacked late on Friday night by three unidentified men with a knife in the Kwai Chung container port area, suffering wounds to his limbs and back, police said. The news was a top-trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo.With protesters and authorities locked in an impasse and Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency laws, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews.", "Taiwan demands China disclose whereabouts of missing citizen,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,31,2019": "TAIPEI--Officials in Taiwan demanded Friday that China disclose information about the disappearance of a Taiwanese man who reportedly distributed photos of Chinese troops massing equipment just outside protest-racked Hong Kong.Friends and family have been unable to reach Lee Meng-chu, a volunteer activity organizer in a small township in southern Taiwan, for 10 days, the Taiwanese government's Mainland Affairs Council said after receiving pleas for help from Lee's family members.Communist Party-ruled China often detains people over political matters and may hold them in an unknown location for several months if they are suspected of threatening national security.\"He was able to be contacted while in Hong Kong and then unreachable once he entered mainland China,\" council spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng told reporters. \"The main thing now is we need to understand his movements and whereabouts, then eventually how to get him safely back to Taiwan.\"Lee entered Hong Kong on Aug. 18, Taiwan's government-run Central News Agency reported. He apparently transmitted photos to his brother and to the township chief showing the paramilitary troops massing equipment on the Hong Kong border with mainland China, the agency said.The drills conducted in Shenzhen city fueled speculation that China might use its People's Armed Police to crush repeated mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.Taiwan and China have had frosty relations since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, but most Taiwanese have told government surveys they prefer autonomy.Further straining relations, Taiwanese officials have repeatedly spoken out in favor of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong.China is supposed to inform Taiwan when it detains Taiwanese citizens under an agreement reached in 2009. Taiwanese officials said Friday they had received no information on Lee's case.The township of Fangliao--a fishing community in southern Taiwan--selected Lee in May as a volunteer consultant to help promote its international affairs because he had studied in the United States and worked in a foreign company in Taiwan, said Mayor Archer Chen.Lee, about 40 years old, often travels to China, Chen said.On the morning of Aug. 20, Lee sent Chen photos of the troops along the Hong Kong border, the mayor said. Later that day, Chen said he tried to call Lee but could not get through.\"At first I figured he was out of power or had lost the phone, but after we couldn't reach him for several days I realized things weren't so innocent,\" Chen said.In another recent case, Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che disappeared in March 2017 on a trip to China and surfaced at a court hearing in the southern Chinese city of Changsha in September that year. The activist who had discussed democracy with mainland Chinese on social media was sentenced to five years in prison for his activities.", "Hong Kong activists freed on bail, protest march banned,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong and another core member of a pro-democracy group were granted bail after being charged with inciting people to join a protest in June, while authorities denied permission for a major march Saturday as they took what appears to be a harder line on this summer's protests.The organizers of the march on the fifth anniversary of a decision by China against allowing fully democratic elections for the leader of Hong Kong said they were calling it off after an appeals board denied permission. It was unclear whether some protesters would still demonstrate on their own.The police commander of Hong Kong island, Kwok Pak Chung, appealed to people to stay away from any unauthorized rallies, warning that those caught could face a five-year jail term.He told a daily news conference that he was aware of social media messages urging people to take strolls or hold rallies in the name of religion. Kwok urged the public to \"make a clear break with all acts of violence and stay away from locations where violent clashes may take place.\"Police have been rejecting more applications for rallies and marches, citing violence at or after earlier ones. They also are arresting people for protests earlier this summer, a step they said was a natural development as investigations were completed.Andy Chan, the leader of a pro-independence movement, was arrested at the airport Thursday night under suspicion of rioting and attacking police. Three other protesters were taken in earlier this week for alleged involvement in the storming of the legislative building on July 1, when protesters broke in and vandalized the main chamber.A leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, which had called Saturday's march, said that Hong Kong residents would have to think about other ways to voice their anger if the police keep banning protests.\"The first priority of the Civil Human Rights Front is to make sure that all of the participants who participate in our marches will be physically and legally safe. That's our first priority,\" said Bonnie Leung. \"And because of the decision made by the appeal board, we feel very sorry but we have no choice but to cancel the march.\"Police arrested Wong and Agnes Chow on Friday morning. They were charged with participating in and inciting others to join an unauthorized protest outside a police station on June 21. Wong was also charged with organizing it.\"We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest and prosecute us,\" Wong told reporters outside a courthouse after they were released on bail.Wong, one of the student leaders of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, was released from prison in June after serving a two-month sentence related to that major pro-democracy protest.Wong and Chow, both 22, are members of Demosisto, a group formed by Wong and others in 2016 to advocate self-determination for Hong Kong.

The last U.S. Navy ship to visit Qingdao was the destroyer Benfold in 2016.Asked why the U.S. request was denied, the U.S. defense official said the question should be directed to Beijing.

While a large crowd rallied in the park, a group of hard-line protesters took over a main street, strewing bamboo poles on the pavement and lining up orange and white traffic barriers and cones to obstruct police.After hoisting warning flags, police used tear gas to try to disperse the crowd. Protesters responded by throwing bricks and gasoline bombs toward the police.

Two water cannon trucks and a phalanx of police vehicles with flashing lights joined riot police on foot as they advanced up the street. They met little resistance.

Four MTR subway stations were closed due to the protests.Police used tear gas after some protesters threw Molotov cocktails and bricks and others tore up \"smart\" lamp posts equipped with surveillance cameras. Other demonstrators had set up roadblocks with bamboo scaffolding.It was the first use of tear gas in more than a week after a series of mostly peaceful demonstrations in the former British colony.The protests, which started over a now-suspended extradition bill and have evolved into demands for greater democracy, have rocked Hong Kong for three months and plunged the city into its biggest political crisis since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.The wider calls for democracy pose a direct challenge for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, who are eager to quell the protests ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1.Transport to the city's international airport appeared normal early on Sunday, despite protesters' plans for a day-long \"stress test\" of transport in the international aviation and financial hub.The protest movement still appears to have broad support, with thousands, including families, lawyers, accountants and young and old people, taking to the streets in anti-government rallies.Demonstrators' demands include an independent inquiry into what they describe as police brutality, a full withdrawal of the extradition bill and universal suffrage.They say they are fighting the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement that enshrines a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since the handover to China.Police said in a statement on Sunday they strongly condemned protesters \"breaching public peace\" and that 19 men and 10 women had been arrested.

Others set up roadblocks with bamboo scaffolding.\"Shame on the MTR,\" some shouted. Others complained about increased surveillance. Station shops were closed.It was not immediately clear why police were wearing the masks, with onlookers wondering if they were a defense against green lasers used by protesters as dusk falls or whether it meant a clash was imminent.The protests, which began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China, have swelled into wider calls for democracy, plunging the city into an unprecedented crisis and posing a direct challenge for Communist Party leaders in Beijing.Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement that enshrines a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997.A smaller, pro-government protest, with people waving the purple bauhinia Hong Kong flag, was held outside broadcaster RTHK's headquarters.British consulate staffer Simon Cheng was detained for 15 days for violating public security management regulations, police in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, said on their Twitter-like Weibo account.Police said Cheng was released as scheduled on Saturday and that his legal rights and interests had been observed. They also said Cheng had confessed to accusations against him, a commonly used comment by Chinese police, even though Cheng was not given a chance to defend himself in court.Cheng had now returned to Hong Kong, his family said on his Facebook page.No details were given of his detention, with the Facebook post asking the \"media and friends to give them some time and space, and we will explain more later.\"Some protesters in recent days had demanded Cheng be released.The rail shutdown by the MTR Corporation comes after it was criticized in Chinese state media, including the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, for allowing \"rioters\" to get away on trains after clashes with police.The MTR had also said on Friday it had been granted an injunction to prevent protesters from disrupting train services. The operator also said that, if \"fights, vandalism or other acts of violence occur,\" train services at affected stations could be stopped immediately.Some online protester messaging groups, however, said they might still walk to the protest site or mobilize elsewhere.\"It's unreasonable that they stop the MTR service ahead of the protest,\" said Louis Wong, a protester in the area.At the airport, all those seeking to enter the terminal had to show valid boarding passes and passports. Train stations feeding the airport, as well as roads to it, were largely clear early on, with a light police presence along some access routes.Cathay Pacific Airways, which has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in the demonstrations, protested against a planned rally by the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions around the airport's \"Cathay City\" HQ on Monday.\"We have reminded our people that the injunction granted to the Airport Authority of Hong Kong also covers Cathay City, which is the operational hub for our global operations and as such includes facilities that are absolutely critical to our flight operations,\" it said in a statement.\" ...

Organizers hoped the chains, which traced three subway routes, would total 40 kilometers in length.It was the latest protest in a nearly 11-week-old movement that began with calls to scrap a now-suspended extradition bill and has widened to include demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality at protests.\"It actually enraged me, the way that the government, the (city's) chief executive and then the police, how they carry out their jobs,\" said Michael Ng, who works in finance and joined the chain outside an upscale mall. \"Very brutal, I would say. We are talking about human rights here.\"Police say their use of tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds has been necessary to clear streets of protesters who have pelted them with eggs, bricks and gasoline bombs.In a protest dubbed \"The Baltic Way,\" nearly 2 million Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians formed a human chain more than 600 kilometers long on Aug. 23, 1989.Organizers of \"The Hong Kong Way\" said it was a show of solidarity against the extradition law and police violence, as well as a plea for international support.Earlier Friday, accountants marched in support of the pro-democracy movement, while the Canadian Consulate banned its staff from leaving the city on official business after a British Consulate employee was detained in mainland China.A major trade union confederation said that the head of the cabin crew union at Cathay Dragon airline had been fired in retaliation for supporting the movement, adding to the chill in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.The Canadian Consulate didn't say whether the travel restriction for local staff was related to the detention of the British Consulate employee, Simon Cheng Man-kit. He went missing two weeks ago after going on a business trip to Shenzhen, a mainland city just across the border.\"At present, locally engaged staff will not undertake official business travel outside of Hong Kong,\" the Canadian Consulate said in a statement.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China respects Canada's decision, but countered it with a Confucius quote: \"A gentleman is open and poised; a petty man is unhappy and worried.\"Geng elaborated that those who are \"above board\" will have their rights guaranteed in China, while people with \"an ulterior motive to engage in illegal activities\" may have to be \"extremely cautious.\"The U.K.'s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it is urgently seeking further information about Cheng, who has worked for the consulate since December 2017 as an international trade and investment officer for the Scottish government.\"Neither we nor Simon's family have been able to speak to him since detention,\" the office said. \"That is our priority and we continue to raise Simon's case repeatedly in China, Hong Kong and London and have sought to make contact with Simon himself.\"Geng said that Cheng's case is a police matter and not a diplomatic issue.China said this week that Cheng had been placed in administrative detention for 15 days for violating public order regulations. The Global Times, a Communist Party-owned tabloid newspaper, reported that Chen had been detained for soliciting prostitutes.China often uses public order charges against political targets and has sometimes used the charge of soliciting prostitution. Ou Shaokun, an anti-corruption activist, alleged in 2015 that he was framed by authorities in southern Hunan province who said they found him in a hotel room with a prostitute.The accountants march drew a few thousand participants who gathered in a city square before heading to government headquarters. They were the latest profession to back the movement publicly following rallies by lawyers, teachers and medical workers.One participant, Sarah Wong, said accountants are usually quiet because they are focused on getting the numbers right, but they cannot remain silent anymore.Kenneth Leung, a lawmaker who represents the accounting industry, said that the extradition bill would have affected accountants, because many of them have clients in mainland China and travel there. The legislation would have allowed suspects to be extradited to the mainland to face trial.\"The profession as a whole needs to come out to express their concerns and grievances,\" he said.Rebecca Sy, the Cathay Dragon union head, told a news conference that the Hong Kong airline had dismissed her without giving a reason, but that the firing came after she was pulled from a flight and asked by an airline representative to confirm that screenshots from Facebook were from her account.\"It's not just about the termination of the job, it's also the whole issue, it's terrifying.

Each of the services bans deceptive practices and inauthentic accounts.The three companies have also come under fire from users for generating revenue and supporting state media and officials in China.Several social media users in Hong Kong have posted screenshots over the last two weeks that they said showed anti-protest advertising from outlets such as China Central Television, or CCTV, appearing on Twitter and YouTube. The ads criticized the Hong Kong protesters.In response, Twitter said Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media, a change that had been in the works for months.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said \"we continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media.\"YouTube said it did not plan to change its ads policies. But YouTube told Reuters that it would soon be expanding its labeling of state-backed media outlets in the region.YouTube places a disclaimer on its services from government-funded networks around the world, including Chinese broadcasters Xinhua, CCTV and CGTN, but it does not yet include the label for Chinese newspapers People's Daily, China Daily and Global Times, Reuters found on Wednesday.Social media companies long have courted closer relationships with news outlets and politicians around the world, hoping that getting them to post on their services would in turn attract more users. But relationships with governments such as China, which regularly faces criticism of its human rights record, have drawn scrutiny from users and lawmakers in the United States.Facebook's Stone confirmed the company has conducted training in China for government and state media personnel.\"We provide a standard set of guidance and best practice training to groups around the world including governments, political parties, media outlets, and nonprofits so they can manage their Facebook Pages,\" he said.Twitter and YouTube did not immediately respond to questions about their support and training for state media outlets, but Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that Twitter has trained Chinese officials on how to use its tools.", "Hong Kong unions urge Cathay Pacific to end \u00e2\u0080\u0098white terror\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,August,23,2019": "HONG KONG--Cathay Pacific Airways, which is caught in the crosswinds between authorities in Beijing and anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, must put an end to \"all forms of white terror,\" trade unions in the Chinese-ruled city said on Friday.The carrier has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) called a news conference after the sudden dismissal of Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon's Airlines Flight Attendants' Association, after a 17-year career.Sy said she was fired, without explanation, after managers saw and confirmed her Facebook account. HKCTU said 14 people have been fired so far over the protests, and called Sy's dismissal a \"blatant act of suppression.\"\"All the employees are being frightened, not just cabin crews, but even the management,\" Sy said. \"My colleagues are all terrified because of its white terror.\"White terror is a common expression to describe anonymous acts that create a climate of fear.Cathay Pacific did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of the airline were down more than 1 percent, lagging a 0.6 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.Sy's departure, which Cathay confirmed on Friday, follows last week's shock resignation of Chief Executive Rupert Hogg, the highest-profile corporate casualty of the unrest.Cathay pilots and cabin crew have described a campaign of political denunciations, sackings and telephone searches by Chinese aviation officials.Recent weeks have been extremely challenging for its employees, the Hong Kong carrier, which is 30 percent owned by Air China, said ahead of Friday's news conference.\"We thank all our dedicated staff who are committed to serving our customers in a professional manner,\" said James Tong, its director of corporate affairs.The demonstrations, which have occasionally shut the airport and businesses in the Asian financial hub, still have broad support, despite some violent clashes between police and protesters.HKCTU said \"white terror\" loomed for the entire aviation industry, and demanded that Sy be immediately reinstated.Walking a tightrope between the protests and political masters in Beijing, many Hong Kong firms are opting to toe the Communist Party line to avoid potential repercussions following the experience of Cathay Pacific Airways.", "Mixed reaction as Yokohama bets on hosting casino resort,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,August,23,2019": "Yokohama on Aug. 22 officially declared itself a player to land one of the three casino-based resort locations that the central government has proposed, pitching a prime bayfront location.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have developed a strong sense of crisis regarding the future of Yokohama,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mayor Fumiko Hayashi said at a regularly scheduled news conference, where she announced the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to seek hosting a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cintegrated resort\u00e2\u0080\u009d (IR).Hayashi listed some of the problems that Yokohama is facing: a population decline after peaking in 2019; a strain in the city's financial condition; a lack of overnight stays by visitors; and the low amount spent per visitor.An integrated resort that will come with an international conference hall, hotel and casino, among other attractions, is a solution to these problems, the mayor said.With Yokohama being the most populated incorporated city and the first municipality in the Tokyo metropolitan area to enter the bidding, the announcement was greeted enthusiastically by chamber officials and the casino industry, and with anxiety from rival municipalities.It also ignited strong opposition and protests from residents concerned of the negative impact that a casino could bring, such as gambling addiction and increased crime.However, Hayashi emphasized that an IR offers many advantages. Upon its completion, a casino-based resort would have an economic ripple effect of about 1 trillion yen ($9.3 billion), and the city would enjoy an increase in tax revenues estimated at about 100 billion yen annually, she said.The candidate site will be Yokohama Port\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yamashita Wharf, which covers 47 hectares of land and is convenient from central Tokyo and Haneda Airport.If selected, the city aims for the opening of the IR in the latter half of the 2020s.The city government will submit an IR-related supplementary budget plan of 260 million yen to a regular session of the city assembly that will start from Sept. 2.The budget will cover research and analysis by experts and a survey on actual cases of gambling addiction.Hayashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formal announcement instantly spurred a political backlash and public protest, due to her previous \u00e2\u0080\u009cundecided\u00e2\u0080\u009d stance on the issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009c(The mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision) is nothing less than a deceptive attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tomoko Abe, a Lower House member who heads the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kanagawa prefectural chapter.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf an IR is as wonderful as she says, then she should seek the people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will in an election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abe said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to do it sneakily.

Young people set up tents as first-aid and battery-charging stations, while older demonstrators of their parents' generation supplied them with drinking water and face masks.There also were roadside \"study tents\" where I met high school students doing their math homework. These teens told me they wished to participate in the movement, even if only for a short time.According to a colleague of mine who is reporting on the current protests in Hong Kong, young people in their teens and 20s appear to be dominating the scene again, as they did five years ago.When someone tells them of an approaching ambulance, they immediately make way for the vehicle. And even on the day they broke into Hong Kong's legislature, they reportedly practiced considerable restraint, reminding one another to refrain from acts of destruction.Now that I am following the developments from Japan, I am deeply disappointed by news of recent air traffic disruptions due to the protesters' occupation of Hong Kong's international airport, as well as reports of occasional outbreaks of violence.But even so, I understand that the demonstrators this time are not resorting to any long-term siege with pitched tents to cut off road networks.The people of Hong Kong have probably learned their lesson from the Umbrella Movement, which caused them fatigue and only proved to be a waste of time.When demonstrators lose restraint, they immediately lose the support of the public. And once that happens, the authorities move in immediately for a crackdown.Lu Xun (1881-1936) famously said the following: \"The earth has no roads to begin with. But when many people pass one way, a road is made.\"I remember these words, written in large letters on a banner carried by Hong Kong demonstrators five years ago.Next week, the current protests will exceed the 79-day duration of the Umbrella Movement.

Her departure follows the resignation of Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg last week.The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions said it will hold a press conference later on Friday to provide details of Sy's departure.The demonstrations show no sign of abating, with activists planning to disrupt transport to the city's airport at the weekend.\"Go to the airport by different means, including MTR, Airport Bus, Taxi, Bike and Private Car to increase pressure on airport transport,\" they wrote online.Hong Kong's international airport, one of the world's busiest, was forced to close temporarily last week and hundreds of flights were canceled or rescheduled when protesters and police clashed.The Airport Authority on Friday published a half-page advert in major newspapers urging young people to \"love Hong Kong\" and said it opposed acts which \"blocked and interfered with the operation of the airport.\" It said it would continue to work to maintain a smooth operation.The protests, which escalated in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial, have grown into wider calls for political freedom.The demonstrations have plunged the Asian financial hub into its deepest crisis since its handover to Beijing in 1997 and pose one of the biggest challenges to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.The unrest has been fueled by worries about the erosion of freedoms under the \"one country, two systems\" formula adopted after Hong Kong's return to China but not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.The protests are already taking a toll on the city's economy and tourism, with the special administrative region on the cusp of its first recession in a decade.Corporates including the big banks and property developers have called for a restoration of law and order while exhibitors are seeing widespread cancellations of events.In the most recent case, international jewelers have sought the rescheduling of a huge trade fair with up to 40 percent of exhibitors threatening to pull out.Demonstrators have five demands: withdraw the extradition bill, establish an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, stop describing the protests as \"rioting,\" waive charges against those arrested and resume political reform.Beijing has sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in Shenzhen, which sits on mainland China's border with Hong Kong.Canada has warned that increased screening of travelers' digital devices had been reported at border crossings between mainland China and Hong Kong.

Recently, the 17-year-old also started describing herself as a patriot who supports China's stance on Hong Kong.The high school student from Shanghai is among the Chinese citizens who in recent weeks have flocked to Western social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter to criticize demonstrators in the former British colony.She is part of a growing offensive emerging from China in recent days aimed at promoting Beijing's narrative about what is happening in Hong Kong to an overseas audience. State media outlets, Chinese celebrities and regular Internet users have all banded together behind the effort.While little news or video footage of the Hong Kong protests made its way into mainland China in the early weeks, the subject now dominates the news and most-read topic lists on China's Twitter-like Weibo, with calls for Chinese citizens to take action to \"protect Hong Kong.\"China's government-owned media outlets have flooded Internet platforms both inside and outside the country with stories and images portraying the Hong Kong protests as the work of \"terrorists\" manipulated by Western powers and \"radical forces.\"They have paid to promote their coverage of Hong Kong on sites including Twitter and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland. The companies said Tuesday that the Chinese government has also mounted a propaganda campaign using fake accounts, thousands of which were taken down in recent days.The efforts have unleashed an unusual dynamic in which mainland citizens who are normally subject to strict controls on their online behavior have been using virtual private networks to bypass the \"Great Firewall\" and spread anti-protest messages internationally, as well as on Chinese social media sites.\"It's only really the hypernationalists that are given free rein, their content isn't censored,\" said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\"They're allowed to conduct campaigns, they're able to organize online ... so that happens in China within the Great Firewall, and then we see also it spill out into the wider Internet,\" he said.But analysts say it's unclear who Beijing is targeting with the campaign, or what the impact has been.Lee Foster, an intelligence analyst at U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the fake account campaigns on Twitter and Facebook were \"relatively unsophisticated.\"\"(It's) not too dissimilar we've seen from Russia about 4-5 years ago in terms of very simplistic personas and the use of identical messaging across accounts,\" he said.King-wa Fu, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Center, said he suspected the impact within Hong Kong was minimal.\"The majority of Hong Kong consume local media content,\" he said.The Hong Kong demonstrations began almost three months ago as a protest against a new extradition law and have since snowballed into a broader movement to defend the city-state's civil liberties in the face of what is perceived to be tightening mainland control.Wang said she and her group of online peers, also known as \"fan girls\" or \"fanquan girls,\" began to campaign against the protests after her idol Zhang, a member of South Korean boy band Exo, joined other Chinese celebrities last week to say that he backed the Hong Kong police and Beijing's territorial sovereignty.\"Since our big brother loves our country so much, we fans have to support him,\" she told Reuters. \"So I went on Instagram to post messages such as 'Hong Kong is part of China,' 'Reject violence' and 'Hong Kong police are the best!'\"They were joined by other Internet denizens such as those on \"Di Bar,\" a discussion forum that is part of search engine giant Baidu's platform, where calls went out to the group's 31.3 million members asking them to flood overseas social media platforms with similar slogans and posts.The Internet movements were endorsed by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday on its nightly news program, one of China's most-watched shows.\"These days, from fanquan girls to Di Bar, netizens to overseas students, all the forces which love Hong Kong and China have united to support and safeguard the city,\" said newscaster Gang Qiang.State television's English-language channel CGTN, the official Xinhua news agency and the Communist Party's People's Daily have all taken to Twitter and Facebook with gusto, denouncing the protesters and putting out Beijing's voice.\"What must be hidden and has to flee is not good, but evil,\" CGTN said in a tweet on Wednesday that was accompanied by a video of masked protesters with captions saying they wanted to hide their identities to avoid retribution.Xinhua and CGTN paid to promote their Hong Kong coverage, according to Twitter's Ads Transparency Center. Neither outlet responded to requests for comment.Twitter told Reuters on Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media.China denounced the moves by Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday, saying it had a right to put out its own views.China's foreign ministry on Tuesday also sent a letter accompanied by a 42-page document to foreign media outlets including Reuters, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal outlining Beijing's stance on the events in Hong Kong.The documents included a timeline of how the protests began, saying that Hong Kong's opposition and some \"radical forces\" had used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests, as well as articles which it said pointed to links between \"foreign forces\" and protesters.", "Hong Kong police in standoff with protesters after sit-in,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,22,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong riot police faced off briefly with protesters occupying a suburban train station Wednesday evening following a commemoration of a violent attack there by masked assailants against supporters of the anti-government movement.Near the end of the event, the police began what they called a \"dispersal operation, using minimum force\" after some protesters blocked roads and flashed laser pointers at officers.Police with riot shields faced off at the station entrance against a group of remaining protesters, who sprayed a firehose and spread soap on the floor to slow a police approach, while piling up trash bins, a wheelchair and umbrellas in a makeshift blockade.They also discharged fire extinguishers, creating a cloud obscuring visibility. The station's entrance shutters were lowered, barricading the protesters inside.The confrontation ended without further incident, as police retreated and protesters left on trains.The black-clad protesters flooded earlier into Yuen Long station to commemorate the July 21 rampage by a group of men suspected of organized crime links, in what was a shocking escalation of the city's summer of protest.The protesters observed a moment of silence, then covered their right eyes, a reference to a woman who reportedly suffered a severe eye injury from a police projectile.Many sat on the station floor, while others walked slowly around the concourse in a protest march.Chanting \"Liberate Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our times,\" they also drew attention to what they say is the lack of progress by police in investigating the attack, which left both protesters and bystanders injured. Protesters have accused the police of colluding with the attackers by delaying their response, but authorities have denied it.Police say they have arrested 28 people in connection with the attack but haven't charged anyone yet. They say some of those arrested have triad links, referring to organized crime syndicates.The anti-government protests began more than two months ago and have spiraled into a political crisis, with supporters demanding full democracy and an investigation into alleged police brutality.The Yuen Long attack came after a massive protest was winding down in July. The assailants, all clad in white in contrast to the protesters' black, swung wooden poles and steel rods, injuring 45 people.Also Wednesday, China said a staffer at the British consulate in Hong Kong has been given 15 days of administrative detention in the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen for violating regulations on public order.The case is stoking fears that Beijing is extending its judicial reach to semiautonomous Hong Kong.\"The relevant employee is a Hong Kong resident, not a British citizen,\" so the case is \"purely the internal affairs of China,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing.A small group of supporters gathered outside the British consulate to demand the U.K. government step up efforts to secure the release of the man, Simon Cheng Man-kit, chanting \"Save Simon now!\"Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China brooked no foreign interference in Hong Kong but understood foreign countries' concerns about the safety of their citizens and investments and was determined to maintain the territory's stability and prosperity under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, which gives Hong Kong wide autonomy.\"We believe the government of the special administrative region can maintain (foreign nationals') proper legal rights.

Protesters at the subway station on Wednesday were angry that nobody has yet been prosecuted for that violence.The standoff stopped short of recent intense clashes with police, who refrained from using tear gas or attempting to storm protesters' lines. Only one rock was seen hitting a police shield and most protesters headed home before midnight.Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial but have since grown into one of the biggest populist challenges faced by Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.The unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the \"one country, two systems\" formula adopted after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 but not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.A flurry of anti-government demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including a rally by students on Thursday and another strike in districts across the city in early September.Continuing protests could deepen the impact on the city's economy, especially small and medium enterprises, Bank of East Asia warned on Wednesday after reporting a 75 percent plunge in its first-half net profit due to loan writedowns in mainland China.The protests are already exacting a toll on Hong Kong's economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.Standard Chartered said in Thursday's advertisements the bank supported the special administrative region's government to uphold social order and \"guard the status of Hong Kong as an international financial center.\"HSBC said all parties must resolve disagreement through communication rather than violence. Neither HSBC nor Bank of East Asia referred to the government in their advertisements.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reiterated on Tuesday that the extradition legislation was dead but has stopped short of withdrawing the bill, as protesters have demanded.Demonstrators are also calling for an independent inquiry, a halt to descriptions of the protests as \"rioting,\" a waiver of charges against those arrested and resumption of political reform.Protests in recent weeks, which have at times drawn more than a million people onto the streets, have also included the storming of the legislature and major disruptions and violence at the airport.Beijing has reacted sharply and has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest.

Everyone is secure with their jobs. We have annual payments. We are comfortable and we are grateful for it,\" said Ms. Leong, a marketing executive who declined to give her first name.Chinese rule has generally been welcomed in Macau, which has seen economic growth soar and a sustained period of stability--a sharp contrast to the years preceding the handover in 1999, when there were a series of mob wars.About half of Macau's population of 600,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was born in the territory. In recent years, millions of dollars have been piled into creating youth associations linked to the Chinese government that encourage study and learning in the mainland. Macau's behavior has pleased Beijing. In state media this week, netizens applauded the swift shutdown of a planned unlawful protest against what activists described as excessive violence by Hong Kong's police.Police told Reuters that dozens of officers were deployed on Monday to the historic Senado Square, where the protest was meant to take place, and that 30 people were \"investigated\". The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said on its online Weibo account \"why are Macau people so excellent#? It comes to the importance of education.\" Other comments praised Macau's police enforcement and local mindset. \"Positive life is meaningful,\" wrote another user. \"Macau doesn't want to respond to Hong Kong. Don't prevent Macau people from making money, you are not welcome to revolt here.\"Ho, who campaigned on integrating Macau's economy with the Greater Bay Area and improving livelihoods, will take over from incumbent Fernando Chui in December as Macau celebrates 20 years under Chinese rule and President Xi Jinping is slated to visit.The Communist Party will also mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on Oct 1. Macau-born Ho moved into government in the early 2000s after starting off in the family business under his industrial tycoon father, Ho Tin. He has no ties to the casino industry, in contrast to previous leaders, and will play a key role in determining what will happen to the six casino operators--Sands China, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco Resorts and MGM China--when their licenses expire in coming years. Ho has said he wants \"healthy\" development for the gambling industry, as it is the main source of tax revenue for the government. He has also warned that the protests and the China-U.S. trade war could hurt Macau's economy.As Hong Kong's protests have intensified, Ho has cautioned against rushing through controversial legislation such as national education and a public investment vehicle, and stated that the government needs to be more inclusive.But Macau pro-democratic activists, mainly in their 20s and 30s, say the city has a broken and undemocratic political system and called on the international community to support Macau's efforts for democratization.An open letter from a group of anonymous locals on Wednesday demanded universal suffrage and said Beijing had been imposing stronger control with increasingly authoritarian rule. \"The time to fight for our universal rights is now, before Macau becomes just another Chinese city,\" the letter said. \"The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong right now.

He said no one in Washington would risk standing up for the company.The biggest impact will be on American vendors that sell chips and other components to Huawei, the biggest maker of network gear for phone companies, he said.Washington has placed Huawei on an \"entity list\" of foreign companies that require official permission to buy American technology.\"Whether the 'entity list' is extended or not, that will not have a substantial impact on Huawei's business,\" said Ren. \"We can do well without relying on American companies.\"Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, is at the center of a battle over trade and technology that threatens to tip the global economy into recession. American officials accuse the company, also the No. 2 global smartphone brand, of stealing technology and facilitating Chinese spying, accusations Huawei denies.Huawei's chief financial officer, who is also Ren's daughter, is fighting extradition from Canada to face U.S. charges related to possible violation of trade curbs on Iran. Beijing arrested two Canadians in a possible attempt to force her release.Ren looked relaxed and confident throughout the two-hour interview at a palatial new building in neoclassical European style where Huawei entertains customers. The atmosphere was a striking contrast from a June 17 news conference at which Ren compared the company to a \"badly damaged airplane\" and warned U.S. sanctions would cut Huawei's projected smartphone sales by $30 billion (3 trillion yen) over the next two years.U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested controls on Huawei might be lifted if Beijing agrees to a deal on trade and technology disputes that led to U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese imports.Ren rejected that. He said Huawei couldn't ask for favors that might hurt the interests of China's poor majority.\"I couldn't take it if those poor people sacrificed their own interests for the benefit of Huawei,\" said Ren. \"Maybe my daughter will suffer more. But I would rather do that instead having the poorer people in China sacrifice for Huawei's survival and development.\"The May announcement of export curbs prompted warnings that sales of Huawei smartphones and other products that use U.S. chips and other technology could be devastated. The curbs also mean a loss of billions of dollars in potential annual sales for American vendors.Even before the announcement, Huawei was working on developing its own chips, software and other technology that might reduce reliance on American vendors. The company spent $15 billion last year on research and development, more than Apple Inc. or Microsoft Corp.Huawei reported sales in the six months through June rose 23.2 percent over a year earlier. Its chairman, Liang Hua, said in July that Huawei was reviewing its core products to make sure they all could be delivered to customers without American components.\"At a strategic level, the U.S. entity list is helpful to Huawei,\" said Ren. He said the company has responded by eliminating \"marginal, unimportant businesses or products\" and focusing resources on \"major products.\"\"The whole company can focus more on our most competitive products,\" he said.This month, Huawei unveiled its own smartphone operating system it said can replace the popular Android system from Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Huawei's phones still use Android but Google is blocked from supporting maps, music and other services.Earlier this year, Huawei released its own chip for next-generation smartphones and the first phone based on that chip.Ren rarely appeared in public or talked to reports before his daughter's December arrest. Since then, however, he has given a flurry of interviews to foreign reporters in an effort to repair the company's reputation.\"I think it's working,\" he said.Asked about ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which borders Shenzhen, Ren said the violence was \"not good for society and the people\" but doesn't affect Huawei.\"There is no impact at all on Huawei's business,\" he said. \"We are still focused on our own production. We still focus on fixing the holes in our bullet-riddled airplane.\"Ren, who has called himself a fan of the United States and publicly praised Trump as a leader, said Huawei wants to retain technology collaboration with Google, Microsoft and other American developers.\"A strong position for Huawei in the market will translate into a strong position for U.S. companies, because deep inside, our products are powered by American technologies,\" said Ren.If Huawei is blocked from using Android and is forced to develop alternative systems, \"it wouldn't be in the best interests of the United States,\" Ren said.He said even if Huawei develops its own alternatives, it is willing to buy American components to support industry development.\"We hope we can and we will continue to be able to buy American components,\" he said. \"Even though we may have the ability to turn out our own components or products, we would choose to reduce our own capacity so as to use more American components in order to contribute together to share the prosperity of society.\"Ren said Huawei is planning as if the U.S. export restrictions will remain in place.\"It isn't possible that someone in the United States will step up to revoke the entity list designation,\" he said. \"Right now, attacking Huawei in the United States is politically correct, while helping Huawei even once would put them under significant pressure. So to us, the entity list will be there for quite some time.\"", "Die-hard Hong Kong protesters defend tactics as unity cracks,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "HONG KONG--On a recent sweltering Saturday, a day now reserved for protest in Hong Kong, a demonstrator named Wayne stepped past a row of plastic barricades, lifted a pair of binoculars and squinted.Four hundred meters away, a line of riot police stood with full-length shields, batons and tear-gas launchers.It was a familiar sight for Wayne after more than two months on the front lines of Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrations. Face-offs with police have become part of the 33-year-old philosophy professor's new normal.The stories of Wayne and three other self-described \"front line\" protesters interviewed by The Associated Press provide insights into how what started as a largely peaceful movement against proposed changes to the city's extradition law has morphed into a summer of tear gas and rubber bullets. They spoke on condition they be identified only by partial names because they feared arrest.The movement has reached a moment of reckoning after protesters occupying Hong Kong's airport last week held two mainland Chinese men captive, beating them because they believed the men were infiltrating their movement.Pro-democracy lawmakers and fellow demonstrators have questioned whether the operation had gone too far.It was the first crack in what has been astonishing unity across a wide range of protesters. It gave pause to the front-liners, though they still believe their more disruptive tactics are necessary to get the government to answer the broader movement's demands.The demands grew from opposing legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited for trials in mainland China's murky judicial system to pressing for democratic elections, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's resignation and an investigation into allegations of police brutality at the demonstrations.The protesters on the front lines have thrown bricks at police, trashed the legislature's chambers, blocked a major tunnel under Hong Kong's harbor and pelted police headquarters with eggs.To Lam, these are \"violent rioters\" bent on destroying the city's economy. To China's ruling Communist Party, their actions are \"the first signs of terrorism.\"To the most die-hard protesters, there's no turning back.\"The situation has evolved into a war in Hong Kong society,\" said Tin, a 23-year-old front-line demonstrator. \"It's the protesters versus the police.\"When Hong Kong's youth banded together to protest, they said they would not have clear leaders, protecting individuals from becoming symbols or scapegoats. And they would stick together, no matter their methods.These were lessons learned from 2014, when the Occupy Central pro-democracy movement fizzled after more than two months.Chong, a 24-year-old front-liner, said everyone's opinion is considered, and they decide on the right path together. But no decision is absolute: The demonstrators have pledged to not impede actions they may disagree with.Two massive marches roused Chong and others who had given up on political change.On consecutive weekends in June, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to oppose the extradition bill. It struck at fears that China is eroding civil rights that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\"I didn't think I would ever do this again,\" said Chong, who quit his job as an environmental consultant for the protests. \"But this time, society is waking up.\"Lam suspended the bill indefinitely the day before the second march, but it didn't mollify the protesters, who turned out in even greater numbers.As their demands expanded, Lam offered dialogue but showed no signs of giving ground.That's when hard-liners like Chong and Wayne became convinced that peaceful protest might not be enough.Week after week, they clashed with police. Every round of tear gas only seemed to deepen their conviction that the government did not care.\"We've had numerous peaceful protests that garnered no response whatsoever from the government,\" said J.C., a 27-year-old hairstylist who quit his job in July. \"Escalating our actions is both natural and necessary.\"Then came the \"white shirt\" attack. On July 21, dozens of men beat people indiscriminately with wooden poles and steel rods in a commuter rail station as protesters returned home, injuring 44. They wore white in contrast to the protesters' trademark black.A slow police response led to accusations of collusion. Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said resources were stretched because of the protests.Many saw the attack as proof police prioritized catching demonstrators--around 700 have been arrested so far--over more violent criminals.As protesters' rage grew, they set their sights on Hong Kong's airport.Hundreds of flights were canceled over two consecutive nights last week as protesters blocked access to check-in counters and immigration.While the major disruption of one of the world's busiest airports got global attention, it was the vigilante attacks on two Chinese men that troubled the movement.In a written apology, a group of unnamed protesters said recent events had fueled a \"paranoia and rage.\" During the prior weekend's demonstrations, people dressed like protesters had been caught on video making arrests, and police acknowledged use of decoy officers.At the airport, the protesters twice thought they found undercover agents in their ranks, detaining two men, interrogating them and beating them. One turned out to be a reporter for China's state-owned Global Times newspaper.Footage of the mob violence inflamed anti-protester sentiment in China. In Hong Kong, pro-democracy lawmakers said it was something that \"will not and should not happen again.\"Some protesters apologized for becoming easily agitated and overreacting. Others questioned whether provocateurs had incited the violence.Wayne said he couldn't get through the crowd to see what was happening during the airport beating, but he understood how the attackers felt.\"I would have done the same thing,\" he said. \"It's not rational, but I would have kicked him or punched him at least once or twice.\"", "Hong Kong leader sees \u00e2\u0080\u0098way out\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of chaos through dialogue,REUTERS,August,20,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of an effort to restore peace and that dialogue with peaceful protesters would provide a \"way out\" for the Chinese-ruled city.Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the 11th week of what have been often violent demonstrations.\"I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,\" Lam said.\"We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hong Kong.\"Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China.But the unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the \"one country, two systems\" formula put in place after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.Further protests are planned in the next few days, including one by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.The chaos has spread overseas. Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. said on Monday they had dismantled a social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.Sunday's turnout, which organizers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.Some activists had apologized for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.Aside from Lam's resignation, demonstrators have five demands--complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as \"rioting,\" a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.\"The second question I have repeatedly replied on various locations and I can give you this very clear commitment at the political level is that the bill is dead,\" Lam said. \"There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.\"Police have been criticized for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.The protests have hit the economy of Hong Kong, one of the world's busiest ports, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.Lam said she hoped Hong Kong had \"unique advantages in attracting overseas companies,\" stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4 percent in April-June from the previous quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,\" she said.Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau said on RTHK Radio that the likelihood of recession was \"quite considerable.\"China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.Hogg's sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.China's State Council on Monday called for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighboring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.The Council called for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the \"one country, two systems\" policy.", "Twitter shuts Chinese accounts targeting Hong Kong protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "WASHINGTON--Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and \"because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed,\" the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations. The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies.\"We continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. \"We're also taking a closer look at ads that have been raised to us to determine if they violate our policies.\"Twitter traced the Hong Kong campaign to two fake Chinese and English Twitter accounts that pretended to be news organizations based in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets since early June calling for full democracy and an inquiry into what they say is police violence against protesters.Though Twitter is banned in China, it is available in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous region.The Chinese language account, @HKpoliticalnew, and the English account, @ctcc507, pushed tweets depicting protesters as violent criminals in a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion around the world. One of those accounts was tied to a suspended Facebook account that went by the same moniker: HKpoliticalnew.An additional 936 core accounts Twitter believes originated from within China attempted to sow political discord in Hong Kong by undermining the protest movement's legitimacy and political positions.About 200,000 more automated Twitter accounts amplified the messages, engaging with the core accounts in the network. Few tweeted more than once, the official said, mostly because Twitter quickly caught many of them.The Twitter official said the investigation remains ongoing and there could be further disclosures.The Twitter campaign reflects the fact that the Chinese government has studied the role of social media in mass movements and fears the Hong Kong protests could spark wider unrest, said James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"This is standard Chinese practice domestically, and we know that after 2016 they studied what the Russians did in the U.S. carefully,\" Lewis said. \"So it sounds like this is the first time they're deploying their new toy.\"Twitter has sought to more aggressively monitor its network for malicious political activity since the 2016 presidential election and to be more transparent about its investigations, publicly releasing such data about state-backed influence operations since October so others can evaluate it, the official said.\"We're not only telling the public this happened, we're also putting the data out there so people can study it for themselves,\" the official said.As for state-backed media organizations, they are still allowed to use Twitter, but are no longer allowed to pay for ads, which show up regardless of whether you have elected to follow the group's tweet.Twitter declined to provide a list of what it considers state-backed media organizations, but a representative said it may consider doing so in the future. In 2017, Twitter specifically announced it would ban Russia-based RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform.", "China lashes out at Taiwan over Hong Kong political asylum offer,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "HONG KONG--China lashed out at Taiwan on Monday over its offer of political asylum to participants in Hong Kong's pro-democracy protest movement, a day after hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully in the latest massive demonstration in the Chinese territory.The government of Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China considers its own territory, strongly supports the protests, and Hong Kong students in Taiwan held events over the weekend expressing their backing. Taiwan's president made the asylum offer last month, though it's not clear if requests have been received.Taiwan lacks a formal legal mechanism for assessing and granting asylum requests, although it has granted residency to several vocal opponents of the Chinese government.On Monday, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Chinese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan's offer would \"cover up the crimes of a small group of violent militants\" and encourage their \"audacity in harming Hong Kong and turn Taiwan into a \"heaven for ducking the law.\"Ma demanded that Taiwan's government \"cease undermining the rule of law\" in Hong Kong, cease interfering in its affairs and not \"condone criminals.\"Organizers said at least 1.7 million people participated in Sunday's Hong Kong rally and march, although the police estimate was far lower. Police said the protest was \"generally peaceful\" but accused a large group of people of \"breaching public peace\" afterward by occupying a major thoroughfare and using slingshots to shoot \"hard objects\" at government headquarters and pointing lasers at police officers.The protests have at times been marked by violent clashes with police, who say they have arrested more than 700 participants since the demonstrations started in June. However, law enforcement officers kept a low profile Sunday, with no riot police seen from the procession's main routes. When stragglers convened outside a government complex in the late evening, other protesters urged them to go home.More protests are planned for the coming weeks, with various rallies organized by accountants, transport workers, high school students and relatives of police officers.Demonstrators' frustrations over what they perceive to be the government's refusal to respond to their demands boiled over last week with the occupation of Hong Kong's international airport, during which a reporter for a Chinese Communist Party-owned newspaper was assaulted, and attacks on a number of police stations.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to Beijing in 1997 under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised residents certain democratic rights not afforded to people in mainland China. But some Hong Kongers have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of eroding their freedoms in recent years.The protest movement's demands include the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, democratic elections and an independent investigation into police use of force.Asked Sunday about the situation in Hong Kong, U.S. President Donald Trump said the use of Chinese troops to put down the protests--similar to the bloody crackdown on protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989--would worsen the current U.S.-China trade dispute.\"I mean if it's another Tiananmen Square, I think it's a very hard thing to do if there is violence,\" Trump told reporters in New Jersey. \"I think there'd be tremendous political sentiment not to do something.\"Trump had originally said the protests were a matter for China to handle but has since suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping could resolve the situation by meeting with protest leaders.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang avoided commenting on Trump's remarks directly, but referred to the president's previous statements on the protests.\"We have noticed that President Trump has previously stated that Hong Kong is part of China, and that they must solve it themselves and do not need advice. We hope that the U.S. side can match its acts to its words,\" Geng told reporters at a daily briefing.China has furiously rejected all outside calls for it to discuss protesters' demands.Members of China's paramilitary People's Armed Police force have been training for days across the border in Shenzhen, including on Sunday morning, fueling speculation that they could be sent in to suppress the protests. The Hong Kong police, however, have said they are capable of handling the demonstrations.", "Chinese K-pop stars publicly back Beijing on Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,19,2019": "HONG KONG--At least eight K-pop stars from China and even one from Taiwan and one from Hong Kong are publicly stating their support for Beijing's one-China policy, eliciting a mixture of disappointment and understanding from fans.Many of the statements came after protesters opposed to Beijing's growing influence over semi-autonomous Hong Kong removed a Chinese flag and tossed it into Victoria Harbor earlier this month.Lay Zhang, Jackson Wang, Lai Kuan-lin and Victoria Song were among the K-pop singers who recently uploaded a Chinese flag and declared themselves as \"one of 1.4 billion guardians of the Chinese flag\" on their official Weibo social media accounts. Wang is from Hong Kong and Lai is from Taiwan.Some see the public pronouncements as the latest examples of how celebrities and companies feel pressured to toe the line politically in the important Chinese market. Yet they also coincide with a surge in patriotism among young Chinese raised on a steady diet of pro-Communist Party messaging.Song and Zhang, a member of popular group EXO, have shown their Chinese pride on Instagram, in Song's case uploading an image of the Chinese flag last week with the caption \"Hong Kong is part of China forever.\" Such posts would only be seen by their international fans because Instagram, like most Western social media sites, is blocked by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's censors.K-pop fans reacted swiftly to the avowals of allegiance to China. Some called it shameful, while others were more understanding.Erika Ng, a 26-year-old Hong Kong fan of Jackson Wang, was not surprised by his statement. She said he \"values the China market more than the Hong Kong market\" because of his large presence in the mainland.Wang, a member of the group Got7, used to carry a Hong Kong flag and wear a hat with the city's symbol, a bauhinia flower. Lately, he has been carrying a Chinese flag on his concert tour and was wearing a China flag hoodie in his music video.Ellyn Bukvich, a 26-year-old American who has been an EXO fan for five years, said many young fans will probably support Zhang and his message because of his status as a K-pop idol.\"It's spreading propaganda and it's very effective,\" Bukvich said.The one-China policy maintains that there is only one Chinese government, and it is a key diplomatic point accepted by most nations in the world, including the U.S. It is mostly aimed at the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.In the case of Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to Chinese control in 1997, Beijing maintains a one country, two systems policy in which the city is guaranteed greater freedoms than those on the mainland until 2047.China's government and entirely state-controlled media have consistently portrayed the Hong Kong protest movement as an effort by criminals trying to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.International brands--from fashion companies to airlines--have in the past been compelled to make public apologies for perceived breaches of that policy, such as listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate countries on their websites or T-shirts.Zhang terminated his partnership with Samsung Electronics last week, accusing the South Korean mobile giant of damaging China's \"sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"The statement in a Weibo post was prompted by Samsung having separate language options for users in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan on their global website. Both Hong Kong and Taiwan use traditional Chinese characters instead of the simplified ones used in mainland China, and Hong Kong also has English as an official languages. Samsung declined to comment on whether it will continue to provide different language options for Taiwan and Hong Kong.It can be difficult to know whether loyalty vows to Beijing are heartfelt or for commercial reasons. The past is littered with examples of celebrities, both Chinese and foreign, who saw their business in China destroyed after the party objected to a statement or an action.In 2016, Taiwanese K-pop star Chou Tzu-yu made a public apology for waving the Taiwanese flag while appearing on a South Korean television show. A Chinese vilification campaign against her led to a backlash among some Taiwanese, who at the time were amid a presidential election eventually won by Tsai Ing-wen, who is despised by Beijing for her pro-independence stance.Public support for Beijing hasn't been limited to pop stars.Liu Yifei, the Chinese-born star of Disney's upcoming live-action version of the film \"Mulan,\" weighed in on the situation in Hong Kong, where protesters have accused police of abuses.\"I support the Hong Kong police,\" she wrote on her Weibo account. \"You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.\"Some questioned her motives, wondering if the post was calculated to ensure her film is released widely in China--the world's largest film market. Among Hong Kong protesters, there were swift calls for a boycott of the film when it is released next year.", "China lashes out at Taiwan over Hong Kong political asylum offer,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,19,2019": "BEIJING--China is lashing out at Taiwan over its offer of political asylum to participants in Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.Spokesman for the Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office Ma Xiaoguang said Monday the offer would \"cover up the crimes of a small group of violent militants\" and encourage their \"audacity in harming Hong Kong and turn Taiwan into a 'heaven for ducking the law.\"The government of the self-ruled island China considers its own territory strongly supports the protests, and Hong Kong students in Taiwan held events over the weekend expressing their backing.

China has also blocked imports of some Canadian commodities.", "Hundreds of thousands turn out for peaceful Hong Kong protest,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,19,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong streets were turned into rivers of umbrellas on Sunday as hundreds of thousands of people marched through heavy rain down a major road in the Chinese territory, where massive pro-democracy demonstrations have become a regular weekend activity. Organizers said at least 1.7 million participated, though the police estimate was far lower.The assembly was peaceful, with no reports of violence, making for a rare calm weekend in a protest movement that has been marked by violent clashes with police. Law enforcement officers kept a low profile, with no riot police seen from the procession's main routes. When stragglers convened outside a government complex in the late evening, other protesters urged them to go home.Demonstrators who were shining laser pointers at a government building were convinced to leave, prompting applause from others in the group.\"We hope to see whether the government gives a response to this peaceful protest,\" said Michael Leung, a 24-year-old who was ushering his fellow demonstrators away. \"If we get a negative response, we cannot control the next (gathering).\"Organizer Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front said earlier in the day that she hoped there would be no \"chaotic situations.\"\"We hope we can show the world that Hong Kong people can be totally peaceful,\" she said.The Civil Human Rights Front had organized three previous massive marches in Hong Kong since June. The movement, however, has been increasingly marked by clashes with police as demonstrators vent their frustrations over what they perceive to be the government's blatant refusal to respond to their demands.\"Peace is the No. 1 priority today,\" said Kiki Ma, a 28-year-old accountant who participated in the march. \"We want to show that we aren't like the government.\"While police granted approval for the rally, they didn't approve an accompanying march. Demonstrators nevertheless fanned out and filled the streets, as there was not enough space at the designated assembly area.Public transit trains did not stop at stations near the assembly because of overcrowding.Jimmy Shan of the Civil Human Rights Front said the group estimated that at least 1.7 million took part in the rally. He said the figure did not include those who were not able to make it to Victoria Park--where the march began--due to traffic constraints.Police, whose crowd figures are generally lower than the organizers' estimates, said the turnout at the assigned location and during the designated time period was 128,000. Many protesters, however, did not follow the pre-approved guidelines laid out by the authorities.In Beijing, You Wenze, a spokesman for China's ceremonial legislature, condemned statements from U.S. lawmakers supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.You called the lawmakers' comments \"a gross violation of the spirit of the rule of law, a blatant double standard and a gross interference in China's internal affairs.\"He said that Hong Kong's 7.5 million people and the Chinese population as a whole rejected the actions of a \"very small group of violent protesters\" as well as \"any interference of foreign forces.\"You did not mention any specific lawmaker, but numerous U.S. senators and Congress members, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have affirmed the U.S. commitment to human rights and urged Hong Kong's government to end the standoff.Congress also has the power to pass legislation affecting Hong Kong's relationship with the U.S. in ways that could further erode the territory's reputation for stability and rule of law.

Water-filled barricades fortify the airport and government offices. Posters showing bloody clashes are stuck on street corners and there is a protest nearly every night.The unrest began in June in opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill, and have since grown to include broader demands.Following an escalation in violence over the past few days, rallies on Saturday and Sunday are a test of whether the movement can retain the broad support it has appeared to enjoy.Saturday's mostly peaceful protest suggested that it may--though thousands also attended a pro-police counter-rally, and a clearer picture is not likely to emerge until Sunday when a protest is scheduled that could draw tens of thousands.\"The government has been ignoring us for months. We have to keep demonstrating,\" said CS Chan, a maths teacher at a rally of teachers, which police said up to 8,300 people had attended, in heavy rain. Organizers said 22,000 were present.Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement that has enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.During the past week they have increasingly directed their frustration toward police, who have responded with fiercer determination to clear them from the streets.As storms cleared, anti-government demonstrators also marched through Kowloon--the main built-up area on the mainland side of Hong Kong harbor--while large pro-police crowds rallied in a harborside park across the bay.\"I'm heartbroken to see the city being split up like this,\" a retired telecoms technician, Michael Law, 69, told Reuters at the pro-police rally. \"What the violent protesters have been doing shows no respect for Hong Kong's rule of law.\"Organizers said 476,000 people attended the pro-police rally, while police said 108,000 attended. Reuters was not able to verify either estimate.Many shops in Kowloon had shut early, even on big retail boulevards, in anticipation of clashes that have tended to turn nasty at night as front-line activists attack police.On Saturday, protesters who had surrounded a police station soon vanished when riot officers advanced with shields and batons.Some said they were saving their energy for Sunday, when the pro-democracy Civil Human Rights Front, which organized million-strong peaceful marches in June, has scheduled another protest.The increasingly violent confrontations have plunged one of Asia's financial capitals into its worst crisis for decades.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when though.\"Alibaba's Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country's fast-growing tech sector.Officials are conscious that capital controls and the U.S. listing preference of most of China's first-generation tech giants mean that international shareholders have profited far more from their success than local investors. Mainland investors can buy Hong Kong shares through the so-called Stock Connect, which allows investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to trade shares listed on each others' exchanges.But the inclusion of Alibaba's Hong Kong shares in the Stock Connect is not guaranteed because the scheme does not yet allow mainland buying of companies which have weighted their voting rights in favor of founders, such as smartphone maker Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping, the online food delivery-to-ticketing firm. Both took advantage last year of another Hong Kong rule change to float in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights structures.While Alibaba has a single class of shares with equal votes, its governance is not considered standard since its board is controlled by a self-selecting group of company insiders.Chinese regulators have said they will allow local investors to trade companies with weighted voting rights, but have not yet set a date for doing so.Alibaba's deal must also overcome one other technical hurdle: it must gain the approval of the city's listing committee, a 27-strong independent group of industry professionals whose consent is needed for all first-time share sales.The company has been in discussions with the committee but has not yet appeared before the group at one of its regular Thursday hearings for formal approval, according to three sources.So far only Credit Suisse and CICC, the Chinese investment bank, have been mandated for the mega-listing, sources said, although several other banks are jockeying for a role on the deal, they added.All are expected to be urging caution on the listing given the size of the deal and the political and market considerations.One senior banker not involved said it made no sense to move too quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would Alibaba rush to kick it off?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.", "U.S. tells Congress of plans to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,17,2019": "WASHINGTON--The Trump administration has informed Congress it plans to sell F-16 fighters worth $8 billion to Taiwan in a move that will inflame already high tensions with China.Two U.S. officials and a congressional aide say the administration informally notified lawmakers of the proposed sale late on Thursday. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The F-16 deal is highly controversial because China fiercely opposes all arms sales to Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province, but has specifically objected to advanced fighter jets. The notification also comes as U.S. trade talks with China are stalled and amid unrest in Hong Kong that many fear could prompt Beijing to move militarily against the former British colony.The State Department, which would ultimately authorize the sale, declined to comment, but members of Congress from both parties welcomed the proposal.The chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Michael McCaul, R-Tex., said in a joint statement that it \"sends a strong message about the U.S. commitment to security and democracy in the Indo-Pacific\" and \"will help deter China as they threaten our strategic partner Taiwan and its democratic system of government.\"\"With China building up its military to threaten us and our allies, and the People's Liberation Army aiming thousands of missiles at Taiwan and deploying fighter aircrafts along the Taiwan Strait, now more than ever it is critical that Taiwan has the support needed to defend itself,\" said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The informal notification starts a period of consultations with Congress and a formal announcement of the sale could be made as early as next month unless lawmakers object.Just this week, America's top representative in Taiwan said Washington expects the island to continue increasing its defense spending as Chinese security threats to the U.S. ally continue to grow. W. Brent Christensen said the U.S. had \"not only observed Taiwan's enthusiasm to pursue necessary platforms to ensure its self-defense, but also its evolving tenacity to develop its own indigenous defense industry.\"That was a nod to President Tsai Ing-wen's drive to develop domestic training jets, submarines and other weapons technology, supplementing arms bought from the U.S.Christensen is the director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which has served as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan since formal diplomatic relations were cut in 1979.While China and Taiwan split during a civil war in 1949, Beijing still considers Taiwan Chinese territory and has increased its threats to annex the self-governing democracy by force if necessary.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, U.S. law requires Washington to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself.Since 2008, U.S. administrations have notified Congress of more than $24 billion in foreign military sales to Taiwan, including in the past two months the sale of 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, valued at $2.2 billion, Christensen said. The Trump administration alone has notified Congress of $4.4 billion in arms sales to Taiwan.China has responded furiously to all such sales and recently announced it would impose sanctions on any U.S. enterprises involved in such deals, saying they undermine China's sovereignty and national security.Tsai has adamantly rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong. She and many Taiwanese have said that the people of the island stand with the young people of Hong Kong who are fighting for democratic freedoms in ongoing protests.Beijing has cut contacts with Tsai's government over Tsai's refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan is a part of China and sought to increase Taiwan's international isolation by reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17.China has also stepped up efforts at military intimidation, holding military exercises across the Taiwan Strait and circling the island with bombers and fighters in what are officially termed training missions.", "French 'spiderman' climbs Hong Kong tower, hoists reconciliation flag amid mass protests,REUTERS,August,16,2019": "HONG KONG--French \"spiderman\" climber Alain Robert scaled a 68-story skyscraper in Hong Kong on Friday to hoist a flag symbolizing reconciliation between China and the territory as weeks of escalating pro-democracy protests show no signs of abating.Using his bare hands and without a harness, Robert clambered up Cheung Kong Center located in the central business district and secured a large banner on the building's exterior.The sign positioned China's flag in the left hand corner with Hong Kong's flag on the right side. Underneath was a yellow hand shaking a red hand on a white background to signify peace.Robert's climb comes as more mass demonstrations are expected through the weekend. China has likened the protests to terrorism and warned it could use force to quell them, as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet with protesters to defuse weeks of tension.It was the third time Robert climbed the Center, which is owned by Cheung Kong Holdings. He was banned from climbing buildings in the former British colony for a year last August. His ban ended two weeks ago.Dressed in bright hues of purple, pink and green, Robert was arrested after the climb and taken to a nearby police station.He often climbs without permission and has been arrested several times, sometimes for trespassing.Li Ka Shing, whose family owns the Cheung Kong Center, published a series of advertisements in Hong Kong's major newspapers on Friday urging people to stop the violence.Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, and have presented the biggest popular challenge to Xi since he came to power in 2012.The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspects for trial in mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.More than 700 people have been arrested since the protests began in June, and tear gas has frequently been used by police in attempts to disperse protests across the city.", "Amazon faces online backlash in China for T-shirts with Hong Kong democracy slogans,REUTERS,August,16,2019": "SHANGHAI--Chinese social media users directed their fury at online marketplace Amazon.com on Thursday, after discovering T-shirts on its website sporting slogans that support anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.The hashtag \"Amazon T-Shirts\" became the fourth-top trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo on Wednesday in the latest backlash for an overseas company that broached matters regarding Hong Kong's territorial status.The widely-read Global Times tabloid, published by China's state-owned People's Daily, said many Chinese internet users found the T-shirts for sale carrying slogans such as \"Free Hong Kong Democracy Now\" and \"Hong Kong is Not China,\" among others.Legions of internet users accused the site of being insensitive towards the Chinese people, with one Weibo commenter writing, \"Amazon has already left China, right? We need to teach this company a lesson.\"The e-commerce giant shut its domestic marketplace Amazon.cn in July, but some overseas goods can still be shipped into the country. The T-shirts were available on Amazon's U.S. website.The company said in a statement, \"Amazon has always and will continue to acknowledge the longstanding and widely-recognized policy of 'one China, two systems'. Every country where we operate has different laws, and we will continue to respect those local laws where we do business.\"Protests in Hong Kong are attracting media attention across the region, as activists have occupied public spaces across the global financial hub for more than 10 weeks, to draw attention to a perceived erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong.At the start of the protests, domestic media from mainland China gave them only limited coverage but they now dominate headlines in both state-owned newspapers and online publications.Several celebrities from mainland China severed ties with a number of fashion labels this week, after online users pointed out they had released apparel that referred to Hong Kong and Taiwan as separate from the People's Republic of China.Versace, Calvin Klein, and other brands each issued public apologies online, either on Chinese social media accounts or overseas ones.Coach, which drew fire for a T-shirt that implied Taiwan was a distinct entity from China, said that in May 2018 it discovered a \"serious inaccuracy\" in one of its clothing items and pulled it from store shelves.", "Trump says China talks 'productive'; Beijing vows tariff retaliation,REUTERS,August,16,2019": "MORRISTOWN, N.J.-- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators were holding \"productive\" trade talks and expected them to meet in September despite U.S. tariffs on over $125 billion worth of Chinese imports taking effect Sept 1.\"September, the meeting is still on as I understand it, but I think more importantly than September, we're talking by phone, and we're having very productive talks,\" Trump told reporters in New Jersey.He said U.S. and Chinese officials had \"a very good conversation\" earlier this week, before his administration delayed until Dec. 15 tariffs on over $150 billion in Chinese imports, including toys, cell phones, and laptop and tablet computers.Nonetheless, China on Thursday vowed to counter the latest U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods but called on the United States to meet it halfway on a potential trade deal.Trump said he did not think Beijing would retaliate for the U.S. tariffs and that he believes China wants to make a trade deal.\"I think we're having very good discussions with China. They very much want to make a deal,\" Trump told reporters. He said he had a call scheduled soon with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but he did not say when.\"I think the longer it goes the stronger we get,\" Trump said of the trade war. \"I have a feeling it's going to go fairly short,\" he said.The Chinese finance ministry said in a statement that Washington's tariffs violated a consensus reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a June summit in Japan to resolve their disputes via negotiation.In a separate statement, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said, \"We hope the U.S. will meet China halfway, and implement the consensus of the two heads of the two countries in Osaka.\"China hopes to find mutually acceptable solutions through dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect, she added.Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020 and had made the economy and his tough stance on China a key part of his 2016 campaign for the White House, on Thursday said any agreement must meet U.S. demands.\"China, frankly, would love to make a deal, and it's got to be a deal on proper terms. It's got to be a deal, frankly, on our terms. Otherwise, what's the purpose?\" Trump said in an interview on New Hampshire radio station WGIR.The trade picture is further complicated by continuing unrest in Hong Kong. Trump on Wednesday tied the situation to any possible agreement, saying Xi must first resolve the issues in the territory with protesters.On Thursday, he used Twitter to call on the Chinese president to personally meet with protesters to spur \"a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.\"Trump and Xi in June had agreed to restart trade talks after negotiations stalled earlier this year. But earlier this month, the Trump administration said it would slap duties beginning Sept. 1 on $300 billion of Chinese goods, which would effectively cover all of China's exports to the United States. He said the partial delay to Dec. 15 for about half the list was aimed at sparing retailers and consumers pain during the Christmas selling season.The tariff plan has roiled global markets and further unnerved investors as the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies stretches into its second year with no end in sight.", "Trump's stance on Hong Kong shows his focus on China trade,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,16,2019": "WASHINGTON-- Rather than speak up strongly for the Hong Kong protesters, President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested the answer to their complaints of Chinese oppression is simply for Beijing's \"great leader,\" Xi Jinping, to meet with them and peacefully sort out the unrest that has been decades in the making.Trump's comments were a far cry from the tougher stances taken by some fellow Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and his predecessors in office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to stand with pro-democracy protesters during moments of unrest. His words are emblematic of a foreign policy approach that focuses narrowly on a trade deal with China, putting it above promoting American values.Trump has fixated on the state of trade negotiations and at times has ignored the counsel of some of his most senior advisers to lower the temperature of the trade dispute with Beijing. Amid stock market volatility this week and talk of a looming recession, worries have grown within the West Wing that escalating trade tensions and tariffs could undermine Trump's best argument for reelection -- a strong U.S. economy.In June, Trump indicated to Chinese President Xi on the sidelines of an international summit in Japan that he would not overtly criticize the Chinese government's efforts to silence the protests in Hong Kong, according to two administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions. As the demonstrations ratcheted up this week, Trump stayed mostly quiet, referring to the moment as \"the Hong Kong thing.\"As he has in the past, Trump retreated to the role of observer to an international crisis, chiming in on Twitter with reactions to what he saw on cable TV but not injecting the United States into the moment.He said Thursday before embarking on Air Force One for a rally in New Hampshire that he doesn't want to see the monthslong protests in Hong Kong met with violence by China.National security adviser John Bolton and economic and diplomatic aides have urged the White House to back the protesters.The State Department on Wednesday expressed deep concern about reports of Chinese paramilitary movement near the Hong Kong border and offered a measure of support for the protests, saying they \"reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.\"The top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee jointly placed the blame squarely on Beijing and recalled the violent crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators in 1989.\"We are concerned that China would consider again brutally putting down peaceful protests,\" said the statement Wednesday by Reps Eliot Engel of New York, the committee chairman, and Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican. \"We urge China to avoid making such a mistake, which would be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.\"Other Republicans have spoken out, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, hitting the notes usually associated with a president:\"To the thousands of young people in Hong Kong who are speaking UP for human rights and speaking OUT against the Communist Party of China: we see you waving the American flag, and we hear you singing our national anthem,\" McCarthy tweeted this week. \"America stands for freedom. America stands with Hong Kong.\"Trump took a more active role Thursday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but in an appeal to Xi, whom he has repeatedly flattered and was careful not to criticize. In a tweet, he urged Xi to meet with the protesters to deliver \"a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.\"Meanwhile, the United States and China appear no closer to a trade deal. Despite Trump's claims to the contrary, the pain of the tariffs is being felt by American consumers and businesses, and forcing companies, when possible, to reconfigure their global supply chains.And the talk of recession, perhaps arriving just months before Americans decide if Trump will get a second term, is worrying his advisers. They're concerned that a slowing economy could cause the campaign to shed voters who were willing to give him a pass on some his incendiary policies and rhetoric because the economy has been doing well.Trump, in an interview Thursday with a New Hampshire radio station ahead of a rally in the state, blamed, as usual, any economic sluggishness on his predecessors and on the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates too high. But he also defended his approach to handling China and dismissed the recent stock market tumble.\"We had a couple of bad days, but we're going to have some very good days 'cause we had to take on China,\" the president said. \"It should have been done by Obama and Bush and everybody else. It should have been done long before I came along.

It's got to be a deal, frankly, on our terms.\"Trump's quiet approach on Hong Kong should not be a surprise. He has repeatedly deprioritized human rights in American diplomacy, from talks with North Korea and Saudi Arabia to China. And he has publicly refused to weigh in on the heavy-handed actions of other nations as he espouses a foreign policy more focused on a narrow view of sovereignty and national interest.The president has repeatedly praised strongmen like leaders in Russia and Turkey for their control over their people and has turned authoritarian tendencies into a punch line.", "U.S. says Taiwan defense spending to rise with China threat,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,15,2019": "TAIPEI--America's top representative in Taiwan said Thursday that Washington expects the island to continue increasing its defense spending as Chinese security threats to the U.S. ally continue to grow.W. Brent Christensen said the U.S. had \"not only observed Taiwan's enthusiasm to pursue necessary platforms to ensure its self-defense, but also its evolving tenacity to develop its own indigenous defense industry.\"That was a nod to President Tsai Ing-wen's drive to develop domestic training jets, submarines and other weapons technology, supplementing arms bought from the U.S.\"These investments by Taiwan are commendable, as is Taiwan's ongoing commitment to increase the defense budget annually to ensure that Taiwan's spending is sufficient to provide for its own self-defense needs,\" Christensen said in a speech. \"And we anticipate that these figures will continue to grow commensurate with the threats Taiwan faces.\"Christensen is the director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which has served as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan since formal diplomatic relations were cut in 1979.While China and Taiwan split during a civil war in 1949, Beijing still considers Taiwan Chinese territory and has increased its threats to annex the self-governing democracy by force if necessary.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, U.S. law requires Washington to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself.Since 2008, U.S. administrations have notified Congress of more than $24 billion in foreign military sales to Taiwan, including in the past two months the sale of 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, valued at $2.2 billion dollars, Christensen said.The Trump administration alone has notified Congress of $4.4 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, he said.China has responded furiously to all such sales and recently announced it would impose sanctions on any U.S. enterprises involved in such deals, saying they undermine China's sovereignty and national security.Tsai has adamantly rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong. She and many Taiwanese have said that the people of the island stand with the young people of Hong Kong who are fighting for democratic freedoms in ongoing protests.Tsai, who says she will seek a second four-year term next year, has said Taiwan was also stepping-up training as it prepared to transition to an all-volunteer force and has raised the defense budget for three consecutive years.China's spending on the People's Liberation Army rose to 1.2 trillion yuan ($178 billion) this year, making it the second-largest defense budget behind the United States.Beijing has cut contacts with Tsai's government over Tsai's refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan is a part of China and sought to increase its international isolation by reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17.It has also stepped up efforts at military intimidation, holding military exercises across the Taiwan Strait and circling the island with bombers and fighters in what are officially termed training missions.", "Chinese paramilitary forces exercise near Hong Kong,REUTERS,August,15,2019": "SHENZHEN/HONG KONG--Hundreds of members of China's People's Armed Police could be seen conducting exercises on Thursday at a sports stadium in Shenzhen, as the U.S. State Department expressed concern that they could be deployed across the border in Hong Kong to break up protests wracking the city.But Western and Asian diplomats in Hong Kong said Beijing has little appetite for rolling the PAP or the People's Liberation Army onto Hong Kong's streets.On Thursday men in fatigues could be seen in a stadium and shouts and whistles could be heard. The stadium is next to a retail complex and shoppers were milling around the area, although the entrances to the stadium were closed.Parking spaces at the stadium were filled with more than 100 dark-painted paramilitary vehicles, including troop trucks, armored personnel carriers, buses and jeeps. At least three were armored wheel-loaders, and two vehicles carried water cannons.\"This is the first time I've seen such a large-scale meeting,\" said Yang Ying, a receptionist at a wellness center inside the stadium's retail complex.\"There have been exercises in the past, but usually they involve traffic police,\" she added. \"Our friends, social media all say it's because of Hong Kong.\"Ten weeks of increasingly violent confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.The protests represent one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.On Wednesday the U.S. State Department said it was deeply concerned about reports that Chinese police forces were gathering near the border with Hong Kong and urged the city's government to respect freedom of speech.Troops marched in and out of the Shenzhen stadium, some in fatigues, some in black T-shirts and camouflage trousers. The floor of an indoor area visible through an open gate was lined with mats and rucksacks.Chinese state media have made several mentions of exercises in Shenzhen.The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, published a slick video early this week showing columns of trucks and armored personnel carriers rolling through the city.The paper said the vehicles belonged to the People's Armed Police and had gathered for \"apparent-large scale exercises.\" Its editor, Hu Xijin, described it on Twitter as \"a clear warning to rioters in Hong Kong.\"The Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper said on the social media platform Weibo that the force handles incidents that include riots and terrorist attacks.\"There is usually PAP in Shenzhen, but this time it appears to directed against Hong Kong,\" said a taxi driver, who gave his surname as Wang. \"Usually they wouldn't hold such a big exercise.\"Still, diplomats in Hong Kong said they believe Chinese leadership is well aware that moving mainland forces into Hong Kong would shatter international faith in the \"one country, two systems\" model at the heart of Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub, and would swiftly lead to sanctions.\"We are seeing an escalation in the posturing that appears designed to send messages to both Hong Kong and the mainland ... but we are confident we are still in the realms of propaganda here,\" one senior Western envoy said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \"The trucks aren't about to roll at this point.\"Alexander Neill, a Singapore-based security analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said it would take far more serious scenarios to spark such a move.\"I think we'd really need to see a total breakdown and a sense that China's national interests were at great risk and could not be protected by the Hong Kong government and its police,\" he said.Worst-case scenarios, he said, could involve the assassination or kidnapping of Chinese officials in Hong Kong, the sacking and occupation of key offices there or the government's losing control of parts of the police force.\"We're a long way from anything like that yet, so I think what we are seeing is harder posturing that is part of a much broader propaganda effort underway on many fronts,\" he said.The Shenzhen stadium sits across the water from Hong Kong's rural hinterland, near a bridge straddling the border.People working around the stadium said the level of PAP activity was higher than they had ever seen, but not disruptive, as the troops usually kept to themselves.The chief disruption was PAP vehicles occupying parking spaces, and people who worked in the area said they'd been told not to share pictures of vehicles.", "2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement leader released on bail,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,15,2019": "HONG KONG--A top opposition leader imprisoned on public disorder charges was released on bail Thursday as Hong Kong's government attempts to quell a protest movement that has paralyzed parts of the territory, including its international airport, and led to hundreds of arrests.Benny Tai was sentenced to 16 months as one of nine leaders of a 2014 drive for universal suffrage known as the Umbrella Movement. He was allowed to return home on $12,755 cash bail but barred from leaving Hong Kong.The 2014 movement fizzled, its demands unmet and leaders arrested. However, it laid the groundwork for the new protest movement that began in June with mass opposition to extradition legislation but has since encompassed more sweeping democratic demands.Flights at Hong Kong's airport have mostly resumed after being mass demonstrations and spasms of violence on Monday and Tuesday. Police made five arrests Tuesday night.Those clashes highlighted the hardening positions of pro-democracy protesters and the authorities.While the movement's supporters still have street protests planned, it's unclear what their next move is.More than 700 protesters have been arrested since early June. Police and the government have pledged to bring all \"culprits\" to justice and to take \"relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice.\"Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific said it had canceled 272 flights, affecting more than 55,000 passengers and had fired two pilots in an apparent response to their involvement in activity related to pro-democracy protests. They included one pilot who is \"currently involved in legal proceedings.\" The airline said earlier this week one of its pilots has been charged with rioting after being arrested during a protest.It said the second fired pilot \"misused company information,\" but gave no other details. The Hong Kong Free Press reported the pilot posted a photo of a cockpit screen on an online forum used by protesters.The airport disruptions grew from a summer of demonstrations aimed at what many Hong Kong residents see as an increasing erosion of the freedoms they were promised in 1997 when Communist Party-ruled mainland China took over what had been a British colony.", "Trump suggests trade deal can wait for Hong Kong resolution,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,15,2019": "WASHINGTON--President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that trade talks with China can wait until tensions in Hong Kong have eased, tweeting: \"Of course China wants to make a deal.

Personal meeting?\" Trump tweeted.Trump has previously said little about the protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, except to make it clear he believes that Hong Kong and China need to \"deal with that themselves.\" He has urged the two sides to exercise caution and voiced hopes that the situation will be resolved peacefully.His more extensive comments Wednesday came as U.S. stock markets tumbled, in part because of uncertainty over Trump's trade standoff with Beijing. Investors have also been rattled about the widespread protests in Hong Kong. Flights resumed at Hong Kong's airport after two days of disruptions that descended into clashes with police.While Trump has been reticent to take sides, some Republican and Democratic members of Congress have voiced their support for the protesters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, issued a statement last week saying that \"dreams of freedom, justice and democracy can never be extinguished by injustice and intimidation.\"The demonstrations are against what many Hong Kong residents see as an increasing erosion of the freedoms they were promised in 1997 when Communist Party-ruled mainland China took over what had been a British colony.Trump said he knows Xi well and called him a \"great leader who very much has the respect of his people.\"Trump also voiced optimism about the off-again, on-again trade negotiations with China. Administration officials publicly and privately have voiced beliefs that a trade deal is still a ways off even as the president voices frustration about the lack of progress. Unhappy with the pace of negotiations, Trump announced two weeks ago that the U.S. would apply 10 percent tariffs on about $300 billion in Chinese imports, beginning Sept. 1. But the administration moved Tuesday to delay the tariffs on a wide range of Chinese-made products, including cellphones, laptop computers, some toys, computer monitors, shoes and clothing. And it's removing other items from the list based \"on health, safety, national security and other factors.\"Trump tweeted that delaying the tariffs would help China more than the U.S. \"The American consumer is fine with or without the September date, but much good will come from the short deferral to December.\"", "U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0098concerned\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reported move near Hong Kong,REUTERS,August,15,2019": "WASHINGTON--The United States is \"deeply concerned\" about Chinese paramilitary movement along the Hong Kong border, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said on Wednesday, while warning that continued erosion of the territory's autonomy put at risk the preferential status it enjoys under U.S. law.Another U.S. official said Beijing had stationed large numbers of paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP) \"near and further out from Hong Kong,\" in response to weeks of street protests in the territory, but said there had been no sign they were moving toward the border.The number of personnel was \"in the thousands,\" said the official, who did not want to be identified.\"They have amped up training and made it all pretty visible,\" he said, but added: \"There are no recent indicators that they are preparing to deploy.\"China's state-run Global Times media outlet reported on Monday that People's Armed Police had been assembling in Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong, \"in advance of apparent large-scale exercises.\"It cited video it had obtained showing numerous armored personnel carriers (APCs), trucks and other vehicles on expressways heading in the direction of Shenzhen over the weekend.

It's seen as mindful of the devastating effect that would have both on the territory's reputation as a safe and stable place to invest in, and as indication of the Communist Party's failure to win over the hearts and minds of the city's 7.3 million residents, 22 years after the former British colony was handed over to China.It would also be a shocking reminder of the PLA's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, which remains a taboo subject in China but is memorialized with a massive rally and march each year in Hong Kong.Yet, mainland China is believed to have already dispatched officers to fortify the ranks of the Hong Kong police, and may also have planted decoys among the protesters in order to encourage more violent acts that could eventually turn ordinary Hong Kongers against the protest movement.Such a change in sentiments does not yet appear to have happened despite rising violence surrounding protests and the shutdown of the city's usually bustling international airport for two days after it was occupied by demonstrators.", "Flights restart at Hong Kong airport as protesters apologize,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,14,2019": "HONG KONG--Flights resumed at Hong Kong's airport Wednesday after two days of disruptions marked by outbursts of violence that highlight the hardening positions of pro-democracy protesters and the authorities in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.About three dozen protesters remained camped in the airport's arrivals area a day after a mass demonstration and frenzied mob violence forced more than 100 flight cancellations. Additional identification checks were in place, but check-in counters were open and flights appeared to be operating normally.Protesters spread pamphlets and posters across the floor in a section of the terminal but were not impeding travelers.

Riot police clashed briefly with the demonstrators, leading to several injuries and prompting at least one officer to draw a handgun on his assailants.The burst of violence included protesters beating up at least two men they suspected of being undercover Chinese agents. Airport security appeared unable to control the crowd, and paramedics later took both men away. Police have acknowledged using \"decoy\" officers, and some protesters over the weekend were seen being arrested by men dressed like demonstrators--in black and wearing face masks.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, identified one of the men as a journalist at the nationalistic Chinese tabloid.\"Fu Guohao, reporter of GT website is being seized by demonstrators at HK airport,\" Hu wrote on his Twitter account. \"I affirm this man being tied in this video is the reporter himself.

Protesters scuffled with police and several police vehicles were blocked amid heated scenes later on Tuesday night, according to witnesses.A policeman was seen drawing his gun at one point.The United Nations human rights commissioner, Michele Bachelet, urged Hong Kong authorities to exercise restraint and investigate evidence that tear gas was fired at protesters in ways banned under international law.China responded by saying her comments sent the wrong signal to what it described as violent criminal offenders.Forward Keys, a flight data company, said the recent wave of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, culminating in the closure of the airport, had deterred people from making plans to visit the city.\"The situation in Hong Kong has deteriorated substantially in the past eight weeks, and particularly so in the past four weeks,\" said spokesman David Tarsh.Long-haul bookings to Hong Kong between June 16 and Aug. 9 were down 4.7 percent from the same period last year, he said.", "Hong Kong airport slowly reopens after crippling protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Some flights started taking off again from Hong Kong's airport Tuesday, though more than 100 remained canceled a day after pro-democracy protesters forced one of the world's busiest transport hubs to shut down to highlight their calls for an independent inquiry into alleged police abuse.A few thousand protesters have once more gathered at the airport, where demonstrations were occurring for a fifth day. Thousands took over the facility's main terminal on Monday, leading to the cancellation of more than 200 flights. The central government in Beijing ominously characterized the protest movement as something approaching \"terrorism\" that posed an \"existential threat\" to the local citizenry.Meanwhile, paramilitary police were assembling across the border in the city of Shenzhen for exercises in what some saw as a threat to increase force brought against the mostly young protesters who have turned out in their thousands over the past 10 weeks.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the ongoing instability, chaos and violence have placed the city on a \"path of no return.\"The demonstrators have shown no sign of letting up on their campaign to force Lam's administration to respond to their demands, including that she step down and entirely scrap legislation that could have seen criminal suspects sent to mainland China to face torture and unfair or politically charged trials.While Beijing tends to define terrorism broadly, extending it especially to nonviolent movements opposing government policies in minority regions such as Tibet and Xinjiang, the government's usage of the term in relation to Hong Kong raised the prospect of greater violence and the possible suspension of legal rights for those detained.Demonstrators have in recent days focused on their demand for an independent inquiry into what they call the police's abuse of power and negligence. That followed reports and circulating video footage of violent arrests and injuries sustained by protesters.Some protesters have thrown bricks, eggs and flaming objects at police stations and police said they arrested another 149 demonstrators over the weekend, bringing the total to more than 700 since early June. Police say several officers have suffered burns, bruises and eye damage inflicted by protesters.Lam told reporters Tuesday that dialogue would only begin when the violence stopped. She reiterated her support for the police and said they have had to make on-the-spot decisions under difficult circumstances, using \"the lowest level of force.\"\"After the violence has been stopped, and the chaotic situation that we are seeing could subside,\" Lam said, \"I as the chief executive will be responsible to rebuild Hong Kong's economy ... to help Hong Kong to move on.\"She did not elaborate on what steps her government will take toward reconciliation. After two months, the protests have become increasingly divisive and prompted clashes across the city.The airport shutdown added to what authorities say is already a major blow to the financial hub's crucial tourism industry.Kerry Dickinson, a traveler from South Africa, said she had trouble getting her luggage Tuesday morning.\"I don't think I will ever fly to Hong Kong again,\" she said.The protests early on were staged in specific neighborhoods near government offices. However, the airport protest was had a direct impact on business travel and tourism. Analysts said it could make foreign investors think twice about setting up shop in Hong Kong, which has long prided itself as being Asia's leading business city with convenient air links across the region.Adding to the protesters' anger, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways told employees in a memo that the carrier has a \"zero tolerance\" for employees joining \"illegal protests\" and warned violators could be fired.Hong Kong was promised democratic rights not enjoyed in Communist Party-ruled mainland China when Beijing took over what had been a British colony in 1997, but some have accused Beijing of steadily eroding their freedoms. Those doubts are fueling the protests, which build on a previous opposition movement that shut down much of the city for seven weeks in 2014 that eventually fizzled out and whose leaders have been imprisoned.While China has yet to threaten sending in the army--as it did against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in 1989--the exercises in Shenzhen were a further demonstration of its ability to crush the demonstrations, even at the cost to Hong Kong's reputation as a safe haven for business and international exchange. Images shown on the Internet showed armored personnel carriers belonging to the People's Armed Police driving in convoy Monday toward the location of the exercises just across the border from Hong Kong.The People's Liberation Army also stations a garrison in Hong Kong, which recently released a video showing its units combating actors dressed as protesters.

Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg told staff the company would report to the CAAC by Thursday on how it would improve flight safety, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.Cathay did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union representing airline employees, has criticized the regulator.In a statement on Saturday, it said the CAAC should have \"respected Hong Kong people's rights and freedoms\" on the basis of the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which guarantees the former British colony a high degree of autonomy from Beijing.", "Hong Kong police demonstrate water cannon as protests linger,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police showed off water cannons Monday as pro-democracy street protests stretched into their 10th week with no sign of either side backing down.The demonstration of specially equipped armored cars came after another weekend of protests at Hong Kong's bustling international airport and on the streets of one of the city's main shopping districts.Legislators and journalists were invited to witness the display of extreme crowd control tactics, which Amnesty International warned last week could lead to serious injuries if misused within Hong Kong's confined spaces.During the weekend protests, website Hong Kong Free Press showed footage of one arrest that appeared to include officers pinning a demonstrator pressed to the ground.

In a separate incident, police lobbed tear gas at protesters who surrounded a precinct in the Tsim Sha Tsui district on the northern side of Hong Kong's harbor, opposite Hong Kong Island.Earlier marches went ahead in two areas despite a police refusal of permission.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" which promises the city certain democratic rights not afforded to people on the mainland. But in recent years, some have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of steadily chipping away at their freedoms.\"I miss the British colony,\" said protester Alexandra Wong, who carried two British flags and wore a T-shirt that said, \"Establish a Democratic China.\"\"After 1997, young people don't see a future,\" she said.Wong, 73, was among protesters carrying British, Taiwanese or U.S. flags. Some chide them for playing into Beijing's claim that hostile foreign forces are behind the demonstrations.Of those accusations, Wong said: \"I don't care what the government says. They will say anything.\"Demonstrators say they no longer trust authorities after 44 civilians were injured in a mob attack at a commuter rail station last month. The assailants were all dressed in white in an apparent rebuttal to the protesters' trademark black.Police have arrested more than 500 protesters since early June on charges such as unlawful assembly, carrying weapons and rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. On a shopping street Saturday, hundreds of people who appeared to be local residents and passers-by surrounded police officers who arrested a woman. They did not respond to the crowd's questions about why she was being arrested.The angered residents booed and shouted one of the movement's catchphrases: \"Hong Kong police know the law and break the law!\"Earlier in the day, a Hong Kong-based association of people from southern Fujian province gathered around police stations to show their support for law enforcement. They held up large in Chinese flags and signs that read, \"Support the Police Line, Firmly Enforce the Law.\"Also on Saturday, several thousand people continued the second day of protests at Hong Kong's busy international airport. They chanted slogans, set up TV sets to show video of recent protests and handed out leaflets explaining the controversy over the proposed extradition law and demands for universal voting rights.In another district, a group of parents staged a separate march that was approved by police. They called for better protection for children following incidents in which ordinary people have been caught in clashes between police and protesters.\"It's dangerous to bring my child to participate in any protest,\" said Natalie Lee, who was with her 2-year-old daughter. \"Today's march provides a good opportunity for us to bring our children to voice our demands and I hope more peaceful protesters will come out too.\"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam defended her government's handling of the protests in a phone call with Britain's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.The protests have strained Beijing's relations with Britain, which has called on China to honor the terms of their handover agreement and the freedoms its promises.In the call Friday, Lam told Raab that while her government \"respects the diverse views held by members of the public on various issues as well as the freedoms of speech and assembly, it will not let violence and illegal behaviors disrupt public order,\" according to a statement issued by her office.", "Hong Kong police fire tear gas as protesters hit and run,REUTERS,August,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters on Saturday--sending tourists fleeing weeping in Kowloon--only for demonstrators to regroup and gather elsewhere during another tense, hot and restive weekend.Weeks of increasingly violent protests have plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis for decades, posing a serious challenge to China's central government in Beijing.On Saturday activists rallied across the city, with thousands occupying the airport arrivals hall for a second day, while elsewhere police displayed a new willingness to quickly and forcibly clear them from the streets.That became a cat-and-mouse chase with demonstrators late into the summer night.Tear gas was used without much warning shortly after several hundred activists who had marched through Tai Po, in the north of the territory, had barricaded an intersection in the Tai Wai neighborhood around nightfall.They dispersed, as noxious smoke also filled the train station there, bringing train passengers to tears.Then demonstrators popped up again in Kowloon, a large urban district on the mainland side of Hong Kong's harbor, only for police to fire another volley of gas from Tsim Sha Tsui police station, sending nearby tourists running with welling tears.Several other exchanges followed, with protesters, wearing helmets and masks, mostly withdrawing when police fired gas or advanced with shields and truncheons, exhausting authorities and leaving the weeks-long stand-off little closer to resolution.Luxury shops were caught up in the protests, with some shoppers even taking pictures of riot police, while other bystanders--at one stage hundreds--jeered the officers.\"If the government thinks we'll give up and not come out anymore they're wrong,\" said student Chris Wong, 20, at Tai Po.\"Carrie Lam is now spreading lies and blaming us for destroying Hong Kong's economy. But she's the one who is destroying Hong Kong,\" he said. \"We'll continue to fight...but we're also going to be smart and wear them down.\"Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said on Friday the economy--already buffeted by China's slowing economy and the U.S.-China trade war--was being undermined by the protests, which began in June.A government spokesman described the day's demonstrations as \"illegal activities\" that have \"been significantly affecting people's daily lives.\"Demonstrators, most of them young, appeared only to be digging in. Late on Saturday they flashed laser pointers at riot police and lifted bricks and scavenged building materials to barricade roads in Kowloon.China, meanwhile, has also targeted the city's corporate giants, demanding flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend staff involved in the demonstrations--a move which also brought pressure on the airline from mainland businesses.The airline told staff on Saturday it would bar any \"overly radical\" employees from crewing flights to the mainland and said it had removed a pilot who was arrested at protests last week from active duty.Neither warning--one aimed at residents and the other at a business emblematic of the city--deterred demonstrators.Leung Wai Man, a housewife in her 60s, said she had been motivated to march in Tai Po because she was angry about what she saw as the violent response by police at some protests.\"We are very angry about the police over arresting our teenagers,\" she said. She said she was worried about escalating violence, but added that \"the protesters were just trying to protect themselves against police violence.\"More demonstrations are planned on Sunday, including at the working class district of Sham Shui Po, the scene of violent confrontations between activists and police, prompting authorities to plan shutting many public buildings there.The protests began after Hong Kong's government tried introducing an extradition bill that would have allowed defendants to be sent to mainland China for trial.The bill has been suspended, but protesters have stepped up their demands and are now calling for greater democracy and Lam's resignation.Young people have been at the forefront, worried about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, while also concerned with issues such as wealth disparities in the city.Thousands of mostly young activists filled the airport's arrivals hall for a second day, some sitting and shouting slogans, while others drew protest posters and greeted arriving passengers.Older people have also been appearing. Earlier on Saturday, in two separate protests, small groups of elderly Hong Kongers and families marched near the financial center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business district. Both marches and the airport protests were peaceful.\"We hope to provide a safer place for parents and their kids to participate in rallies, and to voice their concerns,\" said Fion Yim, 35, representative of the organizing committee for what was billed as the family protest.The protests have been condemned by the central government in Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fueling unrest.Hong Kong was guaranteed freedoms not granted in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, when Britain handed it back to China in 1997.Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab on Friday emphasized the right to peaceful protest in a phone call with Lam, prompting a rebuke from China.", "Hong Kong protesters march in defiance of police ban,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters marched in two Hong Kong neighborhoods Saturday in defiance of a ban by police who have clashed repeatedly with government critics.Hong Kong is in its ninth week of demonstrations that began in response to a proposed extradition law but have expanded to include other grievances and demands for more democratic freedoms.Protesters are calling for the resignation of the territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and an investigation into complaints of abuses by police.Police refused permission for two rallies Saturday but they went ahead despite that. Reporters saw officers in riot gear on a road where hundreds of people gathered for one of the rallies.That followed a separate march earlier Saturday, which received police approval, by parents who called for greater protection for children following incidents in which ordinary people have been caught in clashes between police and protesters.Demonstrators complain China's ruling Communist Party and Hong Kong leaders are eroding the liberties promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.Opponents of the proposed extradition law said it would hurt the independence of Hong Kong courts and expose residents to political cases. The government suspended consideration of the proposed law.Beijing has criticized some protesters as violent radicals spurred on by foreign forces bent on containing China's development.For their part, protesters say police have used excessive force and ignored calls for help when thugs attacked civilians in a commuter rail station.Lam defended her government's handling of the protests in a phone call with Britain's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.The protests have strained Beijing's relations with Britain, which has called on China to honor the terms of their handover agreement and the freedoms its promises.In the call Friday, Lam told Raab that while her government \"respects the diverse views held by members of the public on various issues as well as the freedoms of speech and assembly, it will not let violence and illegal behaviors disrupt public order,\" said a statement issued by her office.Also Saturday, several thousand people dressed in black held a sit-in protest for a second day at Hong Kong's busy international airport.They chanted slogans, set up a TV sets to show video of recent protests and handed out leaflets explaining the controversy over the proposed extradition law and demands for universal voting rights.", "U.S. says Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong \u00e2\u0080\u0098dangerous\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,August,10,2019": "WASHINGTON--Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement \"have gone from irresponsible to dangerous\" and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.\"Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,\" Ortagus added in a tweet.She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: \"This must stop.\"On Thursday, Ortagus called China a \"thuggish regime\" for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate's political section.\"I don't think that leaking an American diplomat's private information, pictures, names of their children--I don't think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,\" she told a briefing.The Hong Kong office of China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline \"Foreign Forces Intervene.\"The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children's details were disclosed.In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said \"foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.\"\"China has a long record of broken commitments; it's their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,\" she said.China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon.", "China waiting out Hong Kong protests, but backlash may come,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "BEIJING--China's central government has dismissed Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters as clowns and criminals while bemoaning growing violence surrounding the monthslong demonstrations.That's partly out of concern that protesters' demands for expanded democracy could inspire like-minded officials and intellectuals on the mainland.Yet, Beijing shows no signs of preparing for a major crackdown, content instead to ignore the protests in the hopes that frustration will lead to further violence that will eventually turn the territory's silent majority against the movement, according to experts.\"Hong Kong poses a serious problem for the Chinese government. It can't allow the protesters to challenge its authority or deface symbols of its authority unpunished but it also does not want to attempt a military crackdown,\" said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.Under those circumstances, Beijing would prefer to \"isolate and undermine the protesters so the movement in Hong Kong fizzles out,\" Tsang said.The protests also come at a sensitive time for President Xi Jinping, who after removing presidential term limits last year effectively made himself leader for life. That has intensified criticism over his concentration of power, even as his propaganda machine relentlessly promotes his image and achievements ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1.Meanwhile, China is grappling with a slowing economy and the ongoing impacts of the U.S.-China trade war, as well as pushback against its ambitious multi-billion dollar \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure program that is seen as miring poorer nations in debt.China's international image has suffered as well from its mass incarceration of members of its Uighur Muslim minority and aggressive moves in the foreign policy sphere, including what professor Anne-Marie Brady of New Zealand's University of Canterbury described in a recent article as \"uncharacteristically undiplomatic activity\" by Chinese diplomats in Canada, Sweden, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.China's activities have included encouraging mainland Chinese students overseas in their attacks on supporters of the Hong Kong protests and Chinese human rights more generally, sparking calls from politicians in those countries for foreign policy adjustments to reduce Beijing's influence.Despite massive Chinese censorship, details of the events in Hong Kong have spread through southern China and among officials and intellectuals in major cities, raising concerns about potential calls for political freedoms like those enjoyed by Hong Kong.\"Beijing fears there might be a copy-cat effect in other cities in China,\" said Willy Lam, a longtime observer of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Attacks on police stations and symbols of Chinese authority and displaying disregard for the law are seen as \"potentially very dangerous\" because they challenge the legitimacy of Beijing's rule in Hong Kong under the \"one country, two systems,\" Lam said.At the same time, many Hong Kongers believe China has broken its promise to allow Hong Kong a high-degree of self-rule, driving protesters to rebel, Lam said. Beijing, he said, is seen as no longer having a \"valid legitimacy to rule Hong Kong.\"The refusal to offer concessions or even open a dialogue with the protesters creates a \"vicious circle\" whereby those in the movement have no choice other than to continue demonstrating or tow Beijing's line, said Joseph Cheng a political analyst now retired from the City University of Hong Kong.\"There's no prospect for reconciliation. It's now a contest of wills,\" Cheng said.And while Beijing condemns the violence, violence is \"precisely what it is hoping for\" in the expectation that frustrated protesters will provide more images of melees and fire bombings that will alienate the general population, Lam said.However, one tactic Beijing is highly unlikely to use is deploying its military, as was used with deadly effect against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, the last time the party saw such open defiance of its authority on the streets of a Chinese city.Deploying the People's Liberation Army would be an \"irrevocable and fateful decision, which would have devastating consequences for Beijing,\" Lam said. \"China would lose face internationally because, after 20 years of Chinese rule, not only has Beijing failed miserably to win hearts and minds, but it now has to use brute force to enforce its will.\"Such a move would have an equally devastating effect on Hong Kong's economy, possibly causing the local stock market that is key to funding the Chinese economy to crash and prompting a mass outflow of foreign investors and capital.Based on Beijing's fiery rhetoric, the numbers of arrests already made and the range of charges being brought--including rioting, which carries a potential 10-year prison sentence--Lam said the authorities are likely to come down much harder than after 2014 demonstrations.\"They hope to use those charges to serve as a warning, but so far the protesters have not been cowed,\" Lam said.Lam and others also expect Beijing to double down on what it terms patriotic education in an attempt to inculcate love and respect for the Chinese state. That will include more lessons on patriotism in the school curriculum, more spending on free tours of key sites in mainland China glorifying the party and economic inducements such as the offer of high-paying jobs in the Pearl River Delta surrounding Hong Kong.Though it's unclear such efforts will succeed, China has the determination and virtually unlimited funds to make young Hong Kongers \"patriotic Chinese citizens,\" Lam said.\"Ultimately, they hope people will just keep their heads down and focus on making money,\" Cheng said. \"But these issues are not resolved and there is a strong chance (a protest movement) will rise again.\"", "Pro-democracy activists protest at Hong Kong airport,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "HONG KONG--Pro-democracy activists rallied at Hong Kong's airport Friday even as the city sought to reassure visitors of their welcome despite the increasing levels of violence surrounding the 2-month-old protest movement.The government concedes road blockages and confrontations between police and protesters have caused inconveniences, but says they were limited to specific areas. The protests, however, were not abating, and more are planned for this weekend, including at the airport, where protesters holding signs staged a sit-in at the arrival and departure halls Friday.Police said they had not received a formal application for the airport protest and warned against violence or disruptions that could endanger public safety. They said they were considering applications for weekend marches elsewhere.Signs held by protesters in the arrival hall included those saying \"There are no rioters, only tyranny,\" while pamphlets stacked in piles warned visitors of the heavy use of tear gas by police. Officers said 800 canisters were used during protests on Monday alone, and journalists and protesters say many suffered skin irritation and internal injuries as a result.While the airport appeared to be operating normally, extra identification checks were put in place for both travelers and staff, and airlines were advising passengers to arrive earlier than usual for check-in.A similar airport protest on July 26 ended peacefully, and there was no indication Friday that police planned to use force to end what was planned as a three-day demonstration.At a briefing, officer Vasco Williams said the force did not plan to issue an outright ban on demonstrations but would gauge each application based on the ability of organizers to maintain order.\"The police will closely monitor the situation this weekend and make respective deployment as necessary. It will be dependent on what happens at the time,\" said Williams, who is operations superintendent for the district of New Territories North.However, Williams and three other senior officers present at the briefing repeatedly declined to answer questions about police tactics, including the alleged use of expired tear gas canisters, or the recall from retirement of former Deputy Commissioner Lau Yip-shing.Lau oversaw the response to pro-democracy protests five years ago in which police were accused of using excessive force. He began serving in the specially created temporary post of deputy commissioner of police for special duties on Friday.Police testing of water cannons for possible use against protesters has also drawn concern, with Amnesty International issuing a statement calling for \"extreme caution\" in any such deployment. Along with tear gas, police have used rubber bullets, sponge-tipped grenades, and beanbag rounds.\"The use of these powerful weapons in the city's densely populated streets could cause serious injuries and further enflame tensions,\" Amnesty said. Police actions so far raise questions as to whether police officers can \"use water cannons in a way that doesn't put people at risk of serious injury,\" the group said.A Hong Kong government statement referring to the travel safety warnings issued by 22 countries and regions appeared to acknowledge the potential for the protests to devastate the territory's crucial travel industry. The statement said the government and the travel industry were working to minimize disruptions and \"all stand ready to welcome and assist visitors to Hong Kong any time.\"The government on Thursday said tourist arrivals dropped 26% at the end of last month compared to last year and were continuing to fall in August. The travel industry accounts for 4.5% of the financial hub's economy and employs about 2500,000 people, or about 7% of the total working population.The impact could be as bad or worse than occurred during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Travel Industry Council Chairman Jason Wong Chun-tat was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post. Wong said cancellations could see hotel revenues in August drop by 40% against the same period last year.Sparked two months ago by proposed extradition legislation that could have seen suspects sent to mainland China--where protesters say they could face torture and unfair politicized trials--the protests have since morphed into calls for broader democratic reforms in the former British colony, along with the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and investigations into alleged police abuse.Hong Kong police say 592 people have been arrested since June 9, ranging in age from 13 to 76. They face charges including rioting, which allows for prison terms of up to 10 years, along with interfering with police duties and taking part in unauthorized gatherings.Demonstrators have at time attacked with metal sticks, bricks, gasoline bombs and carts full of burning debris, while on several occasions, protesters have been attacked by unknown people believed to be linked to organized crime groups.", "China orders Cathay Pacific to suspend staff backing Hong Kong protests,REUTERS,August,10,2019": "HONG KONG/BEIJING--China's aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing's main representative office in the city.On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.Crew members that have not gained the authority's approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: \"We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.\"\"The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific.

They're all adults, they're all service professionals. We respect them greatly,\" he said.Global Times, published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees' participation in the ongoing protests.Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city's economy.Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.The airline has been Hong Kong's flag carrier since the colonial era.

Yet for this Hong Kong, we fight,\" the flyers said.The increasingly violent protests also pose one of the gravest populist challenges yet to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.What started as an angry response to a now-suspended law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in Chinese courts has grown to include demands for greater democracy, the resignation of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, and even keeping out mainland tourists.The airport demonstration came as the city's powerful property developers spoke out for the first time, urging calm after a dozen big companies warned in recent days that the unrest had dented earnings.\"The Hong Kong community has been suffering from the acts of violence perpetrated by a small group of individuals lately,\" said a statement signed by 17 developers, including Henderson Land Development, New World Development 0017.HK, and Sun Hung Kai Properties.\"Such acts have deviated from the original intent of the peaceful demonstrations and are bringing distress to the business community and the general public as a whole,\" it said.There was no sign of a police presence at the airport early on Friday afternoon.\"It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,\" one protester, Charlotte Lam, 16, told Reuters.\"We have made stickers, banners in over 16 languages, ranging from Japanese to Spanish. We want to spread our message internationally. We are not rioters, we are a group of Hong Kongpeople fighting for human rights and freedom,\" she said.Hong Kong has recalled from retirement a police commander who oversaw the response to pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 to help deal with the latest protests, suggesting a lack of confidence in the current leadership.Former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing will handle large-scale public order events, including activities to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, the government said in a statement.The escalating violence has already prompted travel warnings from countries including the United States and Australia, although the airport demonstration did not draw complaints from some travelers.\"I don't really know what to think about the protest down there,\" said a woman from New Zealand who gave her name as Joyce.\"Right now I just hope it won't delay my flight. But at the same time, as long as you're making a point without making too much trouble, it's OK I guess,\" she said.A Taiwanese man named Daloy, 32, welcomed the demonstrators even though his flight was canceled.\"I think this is more important, because today it's Hong Kong and tomorrow it will be Taiwan,\" he said. \"We are also in a dangerous situation.\"The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement on Thursday it supported the stance of Zhang Xiaoming, one of the most senior Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs.Zhang said during a meeting in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen this week Hong Kong was facing its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

The advisory was raised to level two on a four-point scale.Australia also warned its travelers in an updated advisory.The protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with a debilitating trade war with the United States and a slowing economy.Hong Kong is facing its worst crisis since it returned to China from British rule in 1997 because of the protests, the head of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office has said.More protests are planned in several districts across the city this weekend, starting on Friday, with demonstrators also planning a three-day rally at the city's international airport.Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam visited Hong Kong districts on Wednesday to speak with residents and inspect a police station that had been the target of recent protests.The government would put forward measures to improve people's livelihoods, she said in a statement after the visit.Young people have been at the forefront of the protests, angered by broader problems, such as sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.The normally efficient and orderly city has seen its transport network besieged and shut down by demonstrators, while protests have also shut big-brand stores and popular shopping malls.Hong Kong police have arrested 589 people since the protests began in June, the youngest aged 13.Three masked activists, who did not give their names, held a second news conference on Thursday, broadcast on domestic television channels, to discuss what they called abuse of power by the police.\"The continuation of such attempts at spreading fear and suppressing the freedom of press will eventually backfire on the government itself,\" one activist told the Citizens' Press Conference, a platform protesters are using to voice concerns over the situation in Hong Kong.\"The ultimate victim of these tactics will be the police force's crumbling public image,\" added the activist, who spoke in English.The comments came after plainclothes police arrested a student leader from Baptist University on the grounds that laser pointers he bought were offensive weapons.Several thousand Hong Kong lawyers, dressed in black, marched in silence on Wednesday to call on the government to safeguard the independence of the city's department of justice.They fear the justice department's prosecutions of arrested protesters are taking on an increasingly political slant. Many of those arrested have been charged with rioting, which carries a 10-year jail term.Protesters have started to use increasingly diverse tactics to evade capture, shifting quickly from place to place and using online platforms such as Telegram to direct hundreds of people.They also circulated brightly colored pamphlets online ahead of the airport demonstrations, aiming to help tourists understand events, in which they vowed never to surrender.\"Dear travelers, please forgive us for the 'unexpected Hong Kong'. You're arrived in a broken, torn-apart city, not the one you have once pictured. Yet the city you imagined is exactly what we are fighting for,\" the pamphlets said.", "China warns Hong Kong facing biggest crisis since handover,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,8,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong is facing its \"most severe situation\" since its handover from British rule in 1997 following weeks of demonstrations and the central government is considering what measures to take next, the head of Beijing's Cabinet office responsible for the territory said Wednesday.Zhang Xiaoming was speaking to Hong Kong residents attending a seminar in the mainland city of Shenzhen just across the border from the Asian financial hub that has been wracked by daily protests against the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.Those protests are getting increasingly violent and having \"an increasingly broad impact on society,\" Zhang told the 500 attendees, who included members of the Hong Kong and central government legislative and advisory bodies.\"It can be said that Hong Kong is facing the most severe situation it has faced since the handover,\" Zhang said.Officials in Beijing were \"highly concerned\" and studying the situation to decide on measures to take, he said.Hong Kong was returned to China under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised the city political, civil and economic freedoms not allowed under Communist Party rule on the mainland.However, many Hong Kong residents feel Beijing has been increasingly encroaching on their freedoms. The protests were set off by proposed extradition legislation that if passed would have allowed some suspects to be sent to China, where critics say they could face possible torture and unfair trials.China so far has not visibly intervened in the situation, though in editorials and statements from officials it has condemned demonstrators and protest organizers as criminals, clowns and \"violent radicals\" and alleged that they have been inflamed by politicians from the United States, Taiwan and elsewhere.Speculation that the military could be deployed grew after Chinese officials pointed to an article in Hong Kong law that allows troops already stationed in the city to help with \"public order maintenance\" at the Hong Kong government's request.Hong Kong authorities have said they don't anticipate any need to bring in troops or police from China to help impose order. Observers say Beijing will likely try to wait the protesters out, hoping rising violence and inconvenience will turn the tide of public opinion against them.Lam reappeared Wednesday at the opening of an exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state.\"Over recent months, conditions in Hong Kong society have been extremely unstable,\" Lam said in remarks distributed by her office. \"The special administrative region government will certainly join with all of you to deal with it calmly, restore social order, safeguard rule of law and cherish Hong Kong, cherish 'one country, two systems,' and cherish our home.\"Pro-democracy lawmakers continued to criticize Lam's handling of the protests. Claudia Mo told reporters that Beijing and Lam were employing a two-pronged strategy of using the police force to handle the protesters physically while also attacking them ideologically by labeling their movement as seeking to destroy the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\"We all know this (Hong Kong) administration has become completely untrustworthy and this is just so sad for Hong Kong,\" Mo said.With Hong Kong's crucial travel industry suffering as tourists put off their visits, Australia became the latest country to issue a travel safety warning to its citizens.Australians should \"exercise a high degree of caution,\" in Hong Kong, the notice said. It said there was a risk of violent confrontation between protesters and police, or \"criminally linked individuals,\" and visitors should avoid large gatherings, especially at night and on weekends.Ireland, Britain and Japan have already issued Hong Kong travel warnings.Protesters have come from all professions and age groups. On Wednesday, several hundred lawyers sought a meeting with Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng and staged a silent protest. The authorities have refused to open a dialogue with protesters and there was no immediate response from Cheng's office.Margaret Ng, a lawyer and a former lawmaker, said they wanted to meet Cheng and the director of public prosecution to seek an assurance that there was no political motive in prosecution of those detained in the protests.More than 500 people have been arrested since the protests began in June and dozens have already been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\"One of the most important things about the rule of law is prosecution must not be abused because if abused, it is the most powerful instrument of oppression,\" Ng said.She and other lawyers urged protesters to avoid violence that could harm their cause.Lawyer Dennis Kwok said government warnings of stern measures against protesters will merely flame the people's anger. He called for an independent investigation into the actions of police and protesters.Another Chinese official said Tuesday that it would be \"only a matter of time\" before those behind the protests are punished, further indicating that Beijing will take a hard line against the demonstrators and has no plans to negotiate over their demands for political reforms.\"We would like to make it clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: Those who play with fire will perish by it,\" said Yang Guang, spokesman for the Chinese Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.At a daily briefing Wednesday, police spokesman Tse Chun-chung condemned members of a crowd of around 1,000 who the night before surrounded a police station to demand the release of a university student arrested for apparently buying laser pointers.He said police fired 20 tear gas canisters to clear the demonstrators from the blue-collar Sham Shui Po neighborhood. A total of 589 people have been arrested in the protests ranging in age from 13 to 76, Tse said.They include people caught in possession of laser pointers, which are classified as offensive weapons because of their ability to harm the eyes.", "China warns Hong Kong protesters not to \u00e2\u0080\u0098play with fire\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,August,6,2019": "BEIJING--Radical protesters in Hong Kong must not mistake China's restraint for weakness, China's Hong Kong affairs office said on Tuesday, vowing that the \"violent criminals\" pushing the city toward a \"dangerous abyss\" would be brought to justice.Hong Kong has suffered weeks of sometimes violent protests that began with opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland courts.But the protests have swelled into a broader backlash against the government of the Asian financial hub and its political masters in Beijing.\"I would like to warn all of the criminals: don't ever misjudge the situation and mistake our restraint for weakness,\" the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said in a document issued during a briefing in Beijing.A small group of violent radicals were at the forefront of the protests, with \"some kind-hearted citizens who have been misguided and coerced to join,\" according to the document attributed to two officials, Yang Guang and Xu Luying.It said anti-China forces were the \"behind-the-scenes masterminds\" who had \"openly and brazenly emboldened\" the protesters.\"We would like to make clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: those who play with fire will perish by it,\" the office said.\"At the end of the day, they will eventually be punished.\"China has been quick to label U.S. officials as \"black hands\" instigating unrest in Hong Kong in an attempt to contain China's development, but it has not provided any concrete evidence.A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Friday urged the Trump Administration to suspend future sales of munitions and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong police, which have been accused of using excessive force.Police on Monday fired tear gas at protesters in the former British colony after a general strike hit transport and the city's Beijing-backed leader, chief executive Carrie Lam, warned its prosperity was at risk.The protests surpassed earlier shows of dissent in scale and intensity, seemingly stoked Lam's refusal once again to meet any of the protesters' demands, including for her resignation and independent inquiries into police use of force.The protests are the greatest political threat to Hong Kong's government since the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong has remained in barracks since protests started in April, leaving Hong Kong's police force to deal with the massive demonstrations.Last week, the PLA garrison there issued a video showing \"anti-riot\" exercises, and its top brass warned violence is \"absolutely impermissible.\"Diplomats and foreign security analysts are watching the situation closely, but believe there's little appetite in Beijing for the PLA to be deployed on the streets of Hong Kong.So far, the central government and the PLA have said only that there are clear provisions in law covering the prospect of the force's intervention in the city.During the briefing, Yang called the PLA \"a strong force that defends every inch of its sacred territory,\" and said the central government would not allow any \"turbulence\" beyond the control of the Hong Kong government to threaten national unity or security.\"The PLA is a force of power but also a civilized power,\" Yang said.\"As long as it has the strong support of the central government and the Chinese people, the Hong Kong government and police \"are fully capable of punishing those criminal activities and restoring public order and stability,\" he said.", "Extradition protests in Hong Kong morphed into bigger

the protesters' demands, while warning of an \"extremely dangerous situation.\"What started several months ago as demonstrations over an extradition bill that would have let people be sent to mainland China for trial have grown into a much broader backlash against the city government and its political masters in Beijing.The protests are the greatest political threat to the former British colony's government since it returned to Chinese rule and one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Amid extensive disruptions to trains and traffic, tens of thousands of demonstrators fanned out across Hong Kong, spreading pockets of activism to most of its main three regions: Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.Police stations were besieged and roads occupied.In the evening, a group of men armed with sticks tried to attack the black-clad protesters in the North Point district.Riot police used tear gas in districts including Wong Tai Sin, Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, and Admiralty close to the city's government headquarters.Speaking to the media for the first time in two weeks, Lam remained defiant, rejecting calls to resign, condemning violence and saying the government would be resolute.She warned that the protests were putting Hong Kong on a path of no return and had hurt its economy.\"They claim they want a revolution and to restore Hong Kong. These actions have far exceeded their original political demands,\" said a stern-faced Lam, flanked by some, but not all senior members of her administration.\"These illegal acts that challenge our country's sovereignty, and jeopardize 'one country two systems,' will destroy the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,\" Lam said, referring to the territory's administrative system since 1997, when it was handed back to China.Demonstrators fear China is gradually encroaching on the island's cherished autonomy.China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said it would hold another news conference on Tuesday at 2.30 p.m., after one last Monday that announced no new major policy shifts by Beijing despite the upheavals.\"I don't think the government is doing anything to heal society... They provide no solution,\" said Jay Leung, 20, a university student who joined a protest, dismissing Lam's words as a waste of time.\"I didn't hear anything positive, she just made it worse,\" added tourism worker Russell, 38.Demonstrators blocked key roads, including three tunnels, cutting major arteries linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon Peninsula. In Yuen Long district, a car rammed through a barricade, knocking down protesters.Commuters struggled to get to work, with many rail and bus services suspended by activists who blocked trains from leaving stations, some by sitting in doorways.Long lines of traffic snaked across Hong Kong island into the heart of the business center and hundreds of people were stranded at the airport, where more than 200 flights were cancelled at one point.Many businesses shut, and workers stayed home.\"Losing a bit of money now is not such a problem, (compared) with losing everything that the freedom of Hong Kong used to stand for,\" said Mark Schmidt, 49, a restaurant manager who closed on Monday.In an upmarket shopping mall in Sha Tin, scores of shops were shuttered, including clothing retailer H&M as well as luxury brands Chanel and Dior. Protesters in the shopping center chanted: \"Strike! Support to the end.\"Many stores in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay were closed for part of the day as well as businesses close to the protests.Members of the Hong Kong Disneyland Cast Members Union went on strike, as did many lifeguards, forcing authorities to close some beaches and swimming pools.Police, who some have accused of using excessive force, said the situation was spiraling out of control.Authorities said 420 people have been arrested over the protests since June 9, while police have fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas and about 160 rubber bullets.The protesters' demands include a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent inquiry into government handling of the crisis.With tourist numbers falling and hotel occupancy rates slumping, the protests are piling pressure on a struggling economy.IHS Markit's July Purchasing Managers' Index for Hong Kong showed private sector business activity dropped to its lowest level in a decade, also weighed down by the Sino-U.S. trade war.\"I would not be surprised if we see a technical recession--two consecutive quarters of contraction,\" said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at ANZ.The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed down 2.9 percent, falling to its lowest level since January.", "A day of striking sows chaos across Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,6,2019": "HONG KONG--A general strike in Hong Kong descended into citywide mayhem Monday as defiant protesters started fires outside police stations and hurled bricks and eggs at officers. After disrupting traffic early in the day, they filled public parks and squares in several districts, refusing to disperse even as police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets from above.While previous large rallies over the past two months of anti-government protests have generally been held on weekends, Monday's strike paralyzed city operations in an effort to draw more attention to the movement's demands.Hong Kong is on \"the verge of a very dangerous situation,\" said Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who insisted that she has no plans to resign.Lam said at a news conference that the protests had \"ulterior motives\" that threaten Hong Kong's prosperity and security. \"I don't think at this point in time, resignation of myself or some of my colleagues would provide a better solution,\" she said.Protesters challenged law enforcement in at least eight districts, responding to continuous rounds of tear gas with practiced swiftness. They lobbed the canisters back at police and yelled invectives. When police arrived, the protesters clacked their umbrellas together and pounded on metal street signs, daring the officers to move closer.\"Gangsters!\" they jeered at the riot police. \"Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time.\"In one neighborhood after nightfall, a band of men wielding wooden poles charged protesters from behind a thin road lane divider. The demonstrators fought back by throwing traffic cones, metal barricades and rods. Hong Kong media also reported a brawl in a different district where men with knives slashed at protesters.In another neighborhood, demonstrators besieged police headquarters in what they called a \"flash mob.\" They threw bricks and flaming bottles at the building before rapidly retreating.The violence followed a day of striking that sparked bedlam throughout the city. Protesters started early, with the aim of hampering the morning rush hour. In the subway, they blocked train and platform doors, activated emergency alarms and threw objects onto the tracks.A high number of strikers in the airline industry also led to more than 77 flight cancellations, according to the airport authority.\"Too much,\" said 52-year-old John Chan, whose flight to Singapore was cancelled. \"Why do they have to create trouble for people not involved in their cause? Hong Kong is sinking. The government, police and protest people have to stop fighting and give us a break.\"The strike was the latest action in a summer of fiery demonstrations that began in response to proposed extradition legislation that would have allowed some suspects to be sent to mainland China for trials.While the government has since suspended the bill, protesters have pressed on with broader calls for it to be scrapped entirely, along with demands for democratic reforms including the dissolution of the current legislature and an investigation into alleged police brutality. In recent weeks, footage has shown police officers beating protesters and ignoring calls for help during a mob attack that left 44 injured in a commuter rail station.Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997 under a framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised the city certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland. With the arrests of booksellers and activists in recent years, however, some Hong Kong residents feel that Beijing has been eroding their rights.The Communist Party-led central government in Beijing has condemned what it calls violent and radical protesters who have vandalized the Chinese national emblem and more recently thrown the country's flag into the iconic Victoria Harbour. China has accused unnamed \"foreign forces\" of inflaming the demonstrations out of a desire to contain the country's development.CCTV, China's state broadcaster, warned Monday that the \"maniacs and thugs\" will \"pay a price.\"\"Please become aware of your errors, turn back from your incorrect path and set down the butcher's knives,\" said an editorial read aloud on the noon news program.A slick publicity video released last week by the Chinese army garrison regularly stationed in Hong Kong fed speculation that Beijing will deploy the military to quell the mass demonstrations. But Kong Wing-cheung, a police spokesman, said the city's officers are fully supported by the government and there will be no need to deploy the military.More than 400 protesters have been arrested since June 9, when a massive march drew more than 1 million people and launched the protest movement. Those being held, who range in age from 14 to 76, face charges including rioting, unlawful assembly, possessing offensive weapons and assaulting officers and obstructing police operations, said spokeswoman Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan.Yu said police have used 1,000 tear gas grenades and fired more than 300 non-lethal bullets. More than 100 officers have been injured. Yu added that violence has been escalating, with protesters using gasoline bombs and fire.\"If we continue to tolerate and turn a blind eye to lawless behavior, the consequences will be undesirable for our citizens,\" she said.As demonstrators were marching through a business district Monday afternoon, some separated from the line and stopped to heckle a police officer in a watchtower.

He added he's tormented by thoughts of the kind of Hong Kong his 12-year-old daughter will inherit.Tears welled as he watched the ragtag young protesters stream past in their gas masks and helmets. \"If we put them all in jail, how will their parents feel?\" he asked. \"Where will our future go?\"", "Hong Kong police fire tear gas as strikes paralyze city,REUTERS,August,5,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police fired tear gas at protesters on Monday as a general strike plunged the Asian financial hub into fresh chaos, paralyzing transport and bringing the city to an unprecedented standstill for much of the morning.As some train and bus services resumed, tens of thousands of demonstrators fanned out across several districts, where protests again degenerated into running clashes with riot police.Speaking to the media for the first time in two weeks, Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam warned again that the protests were pushing the city to the edge of an \"extremely dangerous situation\" and represented a challenge to China's sovereignty.Lam remained defiant as she rejected calls from protesters demanding her resignation, saying the government would be resolute in maintaining law and order.She warned that the protests were putting the former British colony on a path of no return and had hurt its economy.\"They claim they want a revolution and to restore Hong Kong.

On Sunday, thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories brandishing colorful banners and leaflets.Dressed in black the protesters cheered as they called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters' demands or examining the police violence.Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, cutting a major artery linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.Major shops in the popular tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewelry chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain.Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.China's official news agency Xinhua wrote on Sunday that the \"central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead. \"Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city's economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world's most famous shopping destinations.Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was \"encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.\"", "Hong Kong protesters and police face off in familiar cycle,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,4,2019": "HONG KONG--On one end of a Hong Kong street, protesters dressed in black ducked behind umbrellas and makeshift barricades, occasionally throwing bricks or slinging rocks. On the other end, police decked out in riot gear shouted warnings and fired tear gas.As the late hours of Saturday stretched into the early hours of Sunday, neither side budged. Some residents of neighborhoods embroiled in the scuffles banded together with protesters in an effort to push riot police out and surrounded a police station.Standoffs between demonstrators and authorities have become a weekly occurrence in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory that has been roiled by a summer of fiery protest. What began as demonstrations against a now-suspended extradition bill has ballooned into a broader call for greater democratic freedoms and government accountability.The now-familiar cycle of rallies, police interventions and clashes between the two sides have splintered the city. While tens of thousands marched Saturday through Mong Kok, a bustling shopping area, to call for an inquiry into alleged police brutality, another several thousand in a different part of the city gathered to show support for law enforcement.At one rally, attendees chanted: \"Support the Hong Kong police to strictly enforce the law!\" At another, protesters yelled: \"Police know the law and break the law!\"Several pro-democracy rally participants expressed disappointment in what they viewed as abusive and negligent behavior from police in recent weeks. After thugs dressed in white beat up people inside a commuter rail station, leaving 44 injured, Hong Kong residents accused the police of deliberately being slow to respond. Police, meanwhile, said their resources were stretched because of the ongoing protests.\"I feel so hurt,\" said Zarine Chau, a 56-year-old security guard who was at the pro-democracy march. She said she rarely got involved in politics in the past, but felt moved to do so after seeing videos of police swinging their batons at protesters.\"Why doesn't the government answer to us?\" Chau asked.Members of the movement have demanded the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. As with all the city's chief executives, Lam was not elected by the general population but rather chosen by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.When Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city was promised certain freedoms under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" creating a distance between the territory and the Communist Party-ruled central government on the mainland. In recent years, however, some Hong Kong residents have accused Beijing of chipping away at their democratic rights as booksellers and activists have been arrested. The proposed extradition legislation would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the mainland to stand trial.An undercurrent of fear toward the Communist Party has propelled the nearly two months of protests. After protesters defied police orders to end their Saturday march at a pre-approved time and place, some scaled a flagpole near the iconic Victoria Harbour, removed from it the Chinese national flag, and flung the flag into the water.Shortly afterward, a 38-year-old protester named Paladin Cheng planted himself beside the poles with his own set of flags, which read \"Hong Kong Independence.\"\"We're losing our freedom little by little,\" said Cheng, who was clad in head-to-toe black with a black visor and face mask. \"Those who don't support Hong Kong independence will have no choice but to become Chinese.\"A similar act a few weeks ago infuriated authorities in Beijing when demonstrators threw eggs and black paint at the national emblem on the Liaison Office, which represents the mainland government in Hong Kong. China called the vandalism a \"violent\" act that challenged its authority.Ryan Chan, a chemist, said he sympathized with the protesters' ideals but was dismayed that peaceful demonstrations were increasingly devolving into violence and creating chaos in the city.\"I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people in Hong Kong do not like violence,\" he said. \"The atmosphere here is becoming more and more uncomfortable.\"Police warned in a press briefing earlier Saturday that those who continued beyond the permitted route would be participating in an illegal, unauthorized assembly. Last week, 44 protesters were charged with rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.After scores of officers in riot gear appeared to clear the streets Saturday, some protesters set fire to trash bins and pieces of cardboard, and used sling shots to hurl rocks. Others threw bricks at and spray painted inflammatory language on the outer walls of a police station, then smashed the windows of a car parked in its lot.Clad in their signature hard hats, black shirts and face masks, they once again created barricades with reappropriated road barriers. \"One two, one two,\" the protesters chanted as they fell back in step, only to suddenly charge at police minutes later. Police in turn threw canister after canister of tear gas, enveloping the streets with smoke.As the standoffs dragged on, police also blocked local residents and tourists from returning to their homes and hotels. A mainland Chinese tourist surnamed Wang said he thought the protesters were naive.\"It's impossible for one country, two systems to last,\" said Wang, a retired police officer. \"Sooner or later, they will rejoin China, and our government will deal with them.\"At least for the time being, the protesters seem to be gearing up for a drawn-out struggle. Even as they were retreating from tear gas, they were looking ahead to another planned demonstration, shouting: \"Strike on Monday!\"", "Protesters march in Hong Kong as rival rally supports police,REUTERS,August,3,2019": "HONG KONG-- Thousands of mostly black-clad activists set off on a protest march in Hong Kong's Mong Kok district on Saturday, as the Chinese-controlled city braced for another weekend of anti-government demonstrations.Protests against a proposed bill allowing people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China have escalated since June, growing increasingly violent, with police accused of excessive force and failing to protect protesters from suspected gang attacks.Mong Kok, which includes gritty working class sections and is also a popular shopping destination, was the scene of some of the most violent clashes during pro-democracy protests in 2014.Many of Saturday's demonstraters wore yellow or white hard hats, and the crowds chanted \"age of revolution!\" and \"Hongkongers, add oil!\" - a popular exhortation in Cantonese.\"I'm a little worried about whether the police force might use violent ways on the demonstrators because the route of the demonstration is a little bit narrow, and if we want to leave it might be difficult to get away from the police,\" said a 20-year-old university student named Ivan.\"I think this entire movement will continue until at least the end of 2019,\" he said.Hundreds of marchers held posters with an illustration of protesters in hard hats tending to a young child, with the words \"protect the future\".The crowd was mostly young, but also included families and many older people. Some young couples held hands.\"We are here because we want to stick up for Hong Kong. We don't need an evil law to take over Hong Kong,\" said a woman surnamed Yau who was joined by family members including her 11-year-old daughter.As the marchers gathered at the starting point, one passed around pre-paid subway cards to young groups, while others gave out chicken wings and McDonalds food. When the march started, volunteers handed out hard hats, face masks and water bottles.Most of the shops in the upscale Langham Place shopping mall had pulled down their shutters by late afternoon, and many street-facing businesses along the march route had closed.Across the harbour, on Hong Kong island, thousands of police supporters, mostly wearing white, gathered for a separate rally amid a carnival-like atmosphere in Victoria Park.Many waved Hong Kong and Chinese flags and the crowd shouted slogans in support of the police. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho was greeted with strong applause.\"We are the real Hong Kong people who are not the same as those black-shirted thugs. We don't need a so-called 'HK revolution', we only need to do our best, which is enough,\" he told the crowd.Sylvia Lam, 61, who described herself as a housewife, said she had turned up at the pro-police rally to oppose violence.\"I feel extremely uncomfortable when every time I watch TV, the scenes are so radical,\" she said.\"Young people should stop and think, don't become someone's political tools, be rational please,\" she said.Further anti-government protests were scheduled for Sunday, with activists calling for a mass strike on Monday.On Friday evening in central Hong Kong, thousands of civil servants defied a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral and joined anti-government protests for the first time since they started two months ago.In Washington on Friday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers called on the Trump administration to halt future sales of munitions and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong's police force, which has been accused of using excessive force against protesters.Under Chinese rule, Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary, but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.The protests are the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to China 22 years ago.They also pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012 and come as Xi grapples with an escalating trade war with the United States and a slowing economy in a politically sensitive year.

As rain hit the umbrella-ready crowd, attendees dispersed willingly, avoiding the police clashes that have increasingly beleaguered demonstrations.\"As civil servants, if we don't stand up, that means we are disloyal,\" said K. H. Wu, a retiree who worked for the government's Census Department for 40 years. \"Our loyalties are not to a particular government, but to the people.\"Wu attended the rally with his wife, also a civil servant. He said this was the first time he participated in a rally in which he openly shared his status as a former government worker. He said he did so because he feels \"there's nothing to be afraid of.\"\"Right now the Hong Kong government is blindly leading the people,\" Wu said. \"They disregard the needs of the population. With Hong Kong like this right now, you have to rid yourself of all fear.\"Officials had warned civil servants ahead of the rally they could be disciplined if they showed partiality or criticized special officials and polices. The increased risk was written into posters about the event, which cautioned participants against calling for the resignation of government officials, expressing anything related to Hong Kong independence and accepting donations.As the crowd flooded into the streets, demonstrators held up signs saying \"We are civil servants and willing to step up!\" and \"Political neutrality does not equal conscienceless.\"About a thousand medical workers participated in a rally Friday in another part of the city.

At the end of the drill, soldiers are seen taking some handcuffed civilians away.This week, Hong Kong police arrested 44 people on rioting charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.In the latest action, hundreds of finance workers participated in Hong Kong flash mob Thursday night, demanding the government answer Hong Kong citizens' demands over a controversial extradition bill that sparked the demonstrations and expressing anger over accusations of collusion last month between police and organized crime groups who attacked protesters.Participants carried umbrellas and flashed lights with their cellphones, while chanting \"Hong Kong keep going\" and calling for support for a city-wide strike planned for Monday.\"I think young people should have more opportunity to speak up and the government should have listened to them because young people are the future pillars of our society,\" said Peggie Wong, 42, who works in public finance.Past and present pro-Beijing politicians have alleged that the United States and Taiwan have been guiding the protests, a claim denied by officials including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 on the principle of \"one country, two systems.\" The framework promises Hong Kong certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland.

They are protesting China's influence in the city, a semiautonomous Chinese territory with its own laws and legal system.Police said late Tuesday that 44 people had been charged with rioting and one other with possessing offensive weapons. The accused set up roadblocks, broke fences, damaged street signs and attacked police officers with bricks and iron rods, law enforcement said in a statement.Only 23 appeared in court Wednesday, and all were released on bail. They have to hand over their travel documents and are not allowed to go out in the hours from midnight to 6 a.m. Their sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 25. It was not clear when the others charged will appear in court.They were detained after clashes with police at an unauthorized protest in the western part of Hong Kong island on Sunday, when police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back protesters blocking the streets with road signs and umbrellas. Police issued warnings prior to using the tear gas, but protesters stood their ground and threw eggs at the officers.The large demonstrations started last month as a movement against now-suspended extradition legislation, and have since grown to encompass broader demands around greater democracy and government accountability.The protests have been propelled by an underlying distrust for the ruling Communist Party on the mainland, where speech is tightly controlled and dissenters are routinely jailed.News of the charges prompted quickly organized protests outside two police stations late Tuesday.Several hundred people gathered in the streets outside the Kwai Chung police station. Some threw eggs at the building, while police used pepper spray to try to disperse them. Some had cordoned off an area at a subway station covered in shattered glass where they said an officer had used a firearm.Fireworks were set off just before 3 a.m. at another police station, injuring six men. Video footage on social media appeared to show a car driving by the Tin Shui Wai police station as fireworks flared where protesters were gathered.Five people were taken to a hospital and the sixth man declined medical treatment at the scene, police said. It wasn't clear who was responsible.As the demonstration seeped into the early hours of Wednesday, protesters and supporters remained highly wary of being identified by the authorities and suffering potential retribution at their places of work and study. Volunteers handed out face masks and single-trip subway fare cards that would prevent riders being identified and their trips logged in a central data base, while drivers who had taped paper over their license plates offered rides home.Hong Kong lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki told reporters that the prosecution of protesters and use of police force will only make the situation worse. He blamed Beijing-appointed Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\"The origin of all the violence is Carrie Lam and the very controversial extradition bill,\" he said, adding \"she should come out today to answer to all the requests of most of the people in Hong Kong.\"Kwok also criticized China's repeated statements supporting police efforts to quell the protests, saying Chinese backing would not heal the city.Police have been deploying an increasing range of crowd control measures, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, shotgun beanbag rounds and sponge grenades fired from barrel-mounted grenade launchers.", "Pompeo \u00e2\u0080\u0098very hopeful\u00e2\u0080\u0099 U.S.-N.

He said he's waiting to see if North Korea's foreign minister comes to Bangkok for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and is confident they will meet if he does. The State Department says the lead U.S. negotiator, Stephen Biegun, will be in Bangkok for North Korea-related discussions but has not released his schedule.\"We think they'll be started before too long,\" Pompeo said. \"I'm very hopeful.\"Talks have been stalled since U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's summit in February in Hanoi that broke up over disagreements about sanctions relief and what actions the North would have to take in exchange. But they agreed to restart the talks when they met at the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas in June. At the time, U.S. officials spoke of the negotiations resuming in a matter of a few weeks.\"It's taken a little bit longer than that,\" Pompeo said. \"There's been a little bit of preliminary work to be done. I never want to set a date (but) I hope before too long we will have Special Representative Biegun sitting with what I think will be a new counterpart from North Korea.\"Since the latest Trump-Kim meeting, however, and just in the past week, the North has conducted two short-range ballistic missile tests. And, the two sides remain at odds on a definition of denuclearization. The United States says sanctions cannot be removed until the process is complete, although it has said some concessions are possible in return for partial steps.The annual ASEAN security meeting has been used in the past as a venue for U.S.-North Korea talks and although the North has signaled that its top diplomat may not attend this year, Pompeo was nonplussed.\"We don't anticipate that the North Koreans will be at the event in Bangkok, but if they are, I'd look forward to the chance to meet with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho,\" he said, saying such a meeting \"would be great.\" ''We'll see if they are there, and if they are there, I am confident we'll meet.\"Even if such a meeting does not occur, Pompeo will have a full plate of thorny issues to contend with in Bangkok.Among them, rising tensions with China over its increasingly assertive behavior in the South China Sea, hostility toward pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detentions of Muslims and other minorities in the western region of Xinjiang. Pompeo will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday as talks on ending a bitter U.S.-China trade dispute wrap up in Shanghai.Pompeo will also be seeking in Bangkok to ease brewing tensions over trade between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea that threaten to disrupt Seoul's electronics industry and draws on long-standing bitterness over Japan's actions toward Korea during World War II. The dispute also threatens to poison relations at a time when Washington would prefer to see a united front in dealing with North Korea.On Friday, Pompeo will meet the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers separately before convening a three-way meeting among them.\"We will encourage them to find a path forward. We think it's important,\" Pompeo said aboard his plane. \"They're both great partners of ours; they're both working closely with us on our efforts to denuclearize North Korea. So, if we can help them find a good place for each of their two countries, we certainly find that important to the United States, indeed, as well as to each of those two countries.

Stores and even bank branches have been forced to close for prolonged periods.Many businesses in the port city on the southern Chinese coast are already facing strains from China's economic slowdown and fallout from the year-long Sino-U.S. trade war.Various strikes are planned in coming weeks, while disruptive civil disobedience actions are taking place almost daily and look set to continue for months. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters blocked train services, causing commuter chaos.The main retail association has warned members expect a double-digit drop in sales in July and August. The government will release June sales data on Thursday.\"Hong Kong's retail industry will be affected both internally and externally,\" said Angela Cheng, economist at CMB International Capital Corp.

Prior to the protests, the store had one client per minute, he said, but now it was three to four per hour and daily sales have fallen to HK$20,000 ($2,560 or 277,474 yen) from HK$100,000.\"If the protests last until October, I worry if I can earn enough salary,\" Tang said.Shopping malls are often being used for rest breaks by protesters wearing helmets and goggles and sometimes carrying makeshift weapons.The protesters have been largely respectful of the premises, but on one occasion one mall turned into a battle ground. As police tried to disperse crowds in the Sha Tin working class district on July 14, it ended up chasing them into a shopping center managed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.Fighting erupted and scenes of regular shoppers with bulky bags running away while trying to maintain balance on bloody, slippery floors were broadcast worldwide.Tourism, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly. Britain, Japan, Singapore and others have issued travel alerts.Hong Kong's Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20 percent in June year-on-year, and probably 40 percent in July.A local tour manager who gave only his surname Yu said around two-thirds of his mainland clients have cancelled bookings.Fitch Ratings said in a note on Tuesday the unrest could damage business confidence and the quality of governance. It also raised longer-term concerns about policy paralysis and erosion of the rule of law.A 1992 U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act allowing Washington to have a different customs regime with Hong Kong than with mainland China was also crucial for the stability of the Chinese-ruled city.For it to stand, U.S. authorities need to see Hong Kong as sufficiently independent from Beijing, therefore they will scrutinize the latter's every step during the protests.Fitch affirmed Hong Kong's AA+ rating on June 11.\"Evidence of a permanent loss of confidence in public institutions or tangible reduction of the territory's semiautonomy as granted under the Basic Law, would ... be grounds to review the ratings,\" Fitch said.The American Chamber of Commerce warned that international businesses were feeling pessimistic on short-term prospects and that the government should take immediate actions to address the root causes of the demonstrations.\"The protests have a chance to last until the end of the year.

Hong Kong police said it \"will not rule out the possibility of further arrest\" as it investigates the four others released temporarily or out on bail.Live video streamed by Hong Kong media showed protesters chanting slogans and throwing eggs at the Kwai Chung police station. Police used pepper spray to try to disperse them.The unannounced protest capped another day of unrest. During the morning rush hour, commuters argued with demonstrators who blocked subway train doors in their continuing movement to demand greater accountability from the semiautonomous Chinese territory's government.Service was delayed and partially suspended on the Island and Kwun Tong lines, subway operator MTR said. It cited \"a number of train door obstructions\" as well as someone activating a safety device at a platform on the Kwun Tong line.The action targeted rush hour traffic at several stations. MTR responded by providing minibuses to replace delayed trains, and normal service was restored by around noon.Protester Ken Chan said he wanted MTR officials to explain why they allegedly failed to take action on July 21 when a large gang of men in white shirts brutally beat dozens of people inside a train station as a massive protest was winding down. Hong Kong's government and the central authorities in Beijing have blamed protesters for sparking the confrontation.\"How could they let the triads in white attack people on the platform randomly, including the elderly and children in the train?\" said Chan, 32, using the common term for members of organized crime groups. \"Some of the elderly got smacked on their heads, but (MTR staff) turned a blind eye to it.\"Lorraine Lee, 26, said the subway disruption was an attempt to remind people of the government's alleged failure to deal with social, economic and political injustices.\"The government has not been addressing the problems in our society,\" Lee said. \"That is why now Hong Kongers have no choice but to use different 'creative' approaches to remind people what is happening in Hong Kong.\"Associated Press video showed heated exchanges at Tiu Keng Leng station, where a crowd of protesters and commuters filled the platform and a stopped train.The disruption is part of a pro-democracy movement that has seen hundreds of thousands take to the streets this summer for marches and rallies. The protests have shaken the government in Hong Kong and raised concerns in Beijing. Hong Kong is part of China, but it has a fair degree of autonomy in local affairs.Posts on Twitter showed long lines of commuters waiting for free shuttle buses provided by MTR to other subway stops. Protesters conducted a similar action to block trains last week.Activists began protesting in early June for the government to withdraw an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to stand trial in mainland China, where critics say their legal rights would be threatened. The government suspended the bill, but the protests have expanded to calls for democracy and government accountability.On Sunday, police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back protesters blocking Hong Kong streets with road signs and umbrellas.The protesters have demanded an independent inquiry into police conduct at the demonstrations, which they say has been abusive.China on Monday accused unidentified foreign actors of encouraging the protests. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that the central government \"resolutely opposes any foreign forces' attempts to intervene in Hong Kong affairs.\"\"We have the determination and ability to safeguard peace and stability in Hong Kong,\" Hua said at a daily briefing.On Saturday, Hong Kong police fired tear gas, swung batons and forcefully cleared out protesters who defied warnings not to march.", "HK protesters disrupt train services, cause commuter chaos,REUTERS,July,30,2019": "HONG KONG--Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters blocked train services during the early morning rush hour on Tuesday, causing commuter chaos in the latest anti-government campaign to roil the former British colony.What started three months ago as rallies against an extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial, has now morphed into a wider backlash against the city's government and its political masters in Beijing.Protests have occurred almost daily, sometimes with little notice, disrupting business, piling pressure on Hong Kong's beleaguered government and stretching the city's police force, which some have accused of using excessive force.Activists blocked train doors, playing havoc with services and forcing hundreds of people to stream out of railway stations in search of alternative transport.\"We don't know how long we are going to stay here, we don't have a leader, as you can see this is a mass movement now,\" said Sharon, a 21-year-old masked protester who declined to give her full name. \"It's not our intention to inconvenience people, but we have to make the authorities understand why we protest. We will continue with this as long as need.\"Others chanted, \"Liberate Hong Kong,\" and \"Revolution of our Time.\"Rail operator MTR Corp. said some services had been disrupted and urged people to seek other forms of transport.Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997, is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades after two months of increasingly violent protests that have posed one of the gravest populist challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.China on Monday reiterated its support for Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, and its police and urged Hong Kong people to oppose violence.The latest protest follows a demonstration at the Chinese-ruled city's international airport on Friday and violent protests at the weekend when activists clashed with police who fired rubber bullets, tear gas and sponge grenades--a crowd-control weapon.Minor scuffles broke out between protesters and commuters as some grew frustrated over the train stoppage.\"It's so inconvenient and annoying, really. I am in hurry to work, to make a living. Will you give away your salary to me?\" said a 64-year-old man surnamed Liu.", "Beijing reiterates support for Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lam, police,REUTERS,July,29,2019": "BEIJING/HONG KONG--China reiterated on Monday its support for Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, and its police, and called on Hong Kong people to oppose violence following another weekend of clashes between protesters and police in the city.Hong Kong bore the scars on Monday of its eighth straight weekend of violent protests, with hard hats, umbrellas and water bottles littering some central streets.Millions have taken part in street protests against a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.The protests have at times paralyzed parts of the financial district, shut government offices and disrupted business operations across the city. Officials have also warned about the impact of the unrest on Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy.Beijing has stood by the city's pro-Beijing leader Lam, and the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, which has Cabinet-level authority over the former British colony, reiterated that support at a news conference in Beijing on Monday.\"The central government firmly supports Carrie Lam leading the Hong Kong government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration according to law, firmly supports the Hong Kong police strictly enforcing rule of law,\" Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office, told a news conference.The most important thing was for Hong Kong to handle the unrest according to the law, Yang said, blaming irresponsible figures in the West for stirring up the trouble in a bid to contain China's development.Such efforts would fail, he said.Asked under what conditions the People's Liberation Army could intervene, Yang referred as other officials have done, to Hong Kong's mini-Constitution, known as the Basic Law, which states that the Hong Kong government can ask the PLA garrison in the city to help maintain order.Legal scholars have described that as a high threshold.Yang said Hong Kong's government and society needed to come up with more effective ways to help young people address concerns over housing, employment and other issues, although officials did not announce any specific measures to address the unrest.The past weekend saw more clashes between protesters and police, who again fired rubber bullets and tear gas as the demonstrations grow increasingly violent.Police sought to defend China's main representative office in Hong Kong from protesters on Sunday for the second consecutive weekend, with the building near the heart of the city fortified with barricades.Police said they had arrested at least 49 people over Sunday's protests for offenses including unauthorized assembly and possession of offensive weapons.The protests are the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to China 22 years ago.They also pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China.Many fear Beijing is increasingly chipping away at those freedoms.What began as a movement to oppose the extradition law has taken on broader demands. They include the resignation of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam, calls for full democracy and an independent inquiry into what some say has been excessive force used by police against protesters.Lam has refused to accede to any of the demands.The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said on Monday that, according to a recent survey, international businesses were pessimistic about the short-term prospects for the city due to escalating violence and political deadlock.Respondents reported a deepening perception within their companies and among overseas customers that Hong Kong had become less safe and a riskier place in which to conduct business, it said.A series of protests are planned over coming weeks and the outlook is increasingly uncertain.Labor Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung, who has tried to mediate between activists and police, told Reuters Lam needed to heed demands to withdraw the extradition bill and set up an independent commission, among other requests.\"Short of that, we would only be spiraling down towards even more violence, death, a curfew and even PLA interference,\" Cheung said.", "Police fire tear gas, rubber bullets at Hong Kong protesters,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,29,2019": "HONG KONG--Police in Hong Kong fired tear gas and rubber bullets repeatedly Sunday to drive back protesters blocking streets with road signs and umbrellas in another night of pitched battles in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.It was the second night in a row that tear gas was used in escalating pro-democracy protests. The demonstrations began early last month to voice opposition to an extradition bill that has since been suspended, but the movement has grown to encompass a broader push for full democracy.Protesters occupied two areas at opposite ends of central Hong Kong on Sunday following a mid-afternoon rally against police use of tear gas at a demonstration the previous weekend.On the western end of Hong Kong Island, one group blocked areas near the Chinese government's liaison office and began to move forward as night fell. Police issued warnings, and protesters threw eggs at them. Officers fired tear gas to halt the advance.Police then embarked on an hourslong effort to push the protesters eastward and get them to disperse.In repeated standoffs, spontaneous but highly organized protesters set up behind scaffolding that they built across a street. Police lined up behind clear shields about 30 meter down the road. Dozens of journalists in bright yellow vests stood in between the two on the sidelines.The police would advance gradually, firing bursts of tear gas. Protesters in hard hats scurried about, rearranging makeshift barriers of pilfered road signs and other items. By the time the police reached the scaffolding, they had backed off about 6 meters.Another team of officers, more mobile with smaller shields, then swept in to clear the area. Some protesters were detained, Hong Kong media reported.Hong Kong has been wracked by protests for seven weeks. Initially, the protesters were demanding the scrapping of a proposed extradition law that would send suspects to mainland China to face trials. The legislation is seen as a threat to Hong Kong's freedoms that were guaranteed for 50 years when China took back control of the former British colony in 1997.The bill was eventually suspended, but the protesters then called for the resignation of the city's leader and an investigation into whether police have used excessive force in quelling the protests.Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment, rather than by direct elections.Earlier Sunday, protesters rallied at a park in Hong Kong's financial district before marching out in several directions despite not winning police approval for a public procession. It was the second straight day that protesters took to the streets without official permission.A sea of black-shirted protesters, some with bright yellow helmets and masks but many with just backpacks, streamed out of Chater Garden park. Chanting \"Add oil,\" a phrase that roughly means \"Keep up the fight,\" a huge crowd marched east down a wide thoroughfare.They stopped near the Sogo department store and set up barricades to block off the area and defend it against police.Another group headed west toward mainland China's liaison office. Protesters egged the office last weekend and splattered black ink on the national emblem, eliciting an angry reaction from the Chinese government.Some stopped about two blocks short of the office and used orange and white construction barricades to build a wall spanning a major road. They massed behind the barriers as night fell, with umbrellas pointed forward to shield their identities and ward off any police move to clear them.Some nearby stores shuttered early as police in riot gear gathered nearby ahead of the all but inevitable clearing operation.The rally in Chater Garden was called to protest the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other force to break up a protest the previous Sunday.\"We need to have a protest to show that we are strongly against this kind of brutality and we need them to respond to our demands,\" said rally organizer Ventus Lau.Police had denied Lau's request to march west to the Sheung Wan district, where the tear gas was used the previous weekend, citing escalating violence in clashes with protesters that have broken out after past marches and rallies.\"The police must prevent aggressive protesters from exploiting a peaceful procession to cause troubles and violent clashes,\" said Superintendent Louis Lau of the police public relations branch.On Saturday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as demonstrators threw bricks and other objects and ducked behind makeshift shields at a march in an outlying district toward the border with mainland China.Police had also denied permission for that protest in Yuen Long, where a mob apparently targeting demonstrators had beaten people brutally in a train station the previous weekend.Police wearing helmets charged into the same train station, where a few hundred protesters had taken refuge from the tear gas. Some officers swung their batons at demonstrators, while others appeared to be urging their colleagues to hang back. For the second week in a row, blood was splattered on the station floor.Police arrested 13 people, including march organizer Max Chung, for offenses including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assault, according to police and Hong Kong media. At least four officers were injured.The Hospital Authority said 24 people were taken to five hospitals. As of Sunday morning, eight remained hospitalized, two in serious condition.Amnesty International, the human rights group, called the police response heavy-handed and unacceptable.\"While police must be able to defend themselves, there were repeated instances today where police officers were the aggressors,\" Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said in a statement.Police said they had to use what they termed \"appropriate force\" because of the bricks and other objects thrown at them, including glass bottles with a suspected corrosive fluid inside.", "Hong Kong protesters target police use of force in march,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,28,2019": "HONG KONG--A sea of black-shirted protesters, some with bright yellow helmets and masks but many with just backpacks, marched down a major street in central Hong Kong on Sunday in the latest rally in what has become a summer of protest.The march followed a short rally at Chater Garden, a park in the financial district, against the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other force to break up a protest the previous Sunday.Police had denied permission to the organizers to march to the Sheung Wan district, where the tear gas was used. In a surprise move, the protesters headed in the opposite direction.Chanting \"Add oil,\" a phrase that roughly means \"Keep up the fight,\" they walked past government and police headquarters. Their destination was unclear.Hong Kong has been wracked by protests for seven weeks, as opposition to an extradition bill has morphed into demands for the resignation of the city's leader and an investigation into whether police have used excessive force in quelling the protests.Underlying the movement is a broader push for full democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The city's leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment, rather than by direct elections.Police had denied a request from protest organizers to march about 2 kilometers west to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Park, citing escalating violence in clashes with protesters that have broken out after past marches and rallies.\"The police must prevent aggressive protesters from exploiting a peaceful procession to cause troubles and violent clashes,\" said Superintendent Louis Lau of the police public relations branch.On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police led to 11 arrests and left at least two dozen injured in an outlying district toward the border with mainland China.The police had also denied permission for that march in Yuen Long, where a mob apparently targeting demonstrators had beaten people brutally in a train station the previous weekend.Protesters and police faced off in the streets well into the night, as they've done repeatedly during the summer's pro-democracy protests.Police said protesters removed fences from roads to make their own roadblocks and charged police lines with metal poles. One group surrounded and vandalized a police vehicle, causing danger to officers on board, a police statement said.Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets as demonstrators threw bricks and other objects and ducked behind makeshift shields.Later, police wearing helmets charged into the train station, where a few hundred protesters had taken refuge from the tear gas. Some officers swung their batons at demonstrators, while others appeared to be urging their colleagues to hang back. For the second week in a row, blood was splattered on the station floor.Police said in a statement that they arrested 11 men, aged between 18 and 68, for offenses including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assault.

Demonstrators threw objects and ducked behind makeshift shields, and police officers shot plumes of tear gas into the air.For the protesters, it was a show of defiance against both the police and the white-clad assailants who beat dozens of people July 21, including some demonstrators heading home after a mass protest.Police said some of the attackers at the train station were connected to triad gangs and others were villagers who live in the area. Demonstrators accused law enforcement of not acting quickly enough to protect the victims and even colluding with the mob, an allegation that police have firmly denied.The streets of Yuen Long became a sea of umbrellas as the march began Saturday afternoon. A symbol going back to the Occupy Central protests that shook Hong Kong in 2014, umbrellas have become tools to help protesters conceal their identities from police cameras as well as shields against tear gas and pepper spray. Some also wore masks.\"Hong Kong police know the law and break the law,\" protesters chanted as they made their way through the streets.Max Chung Kin-ping, one of the rally's organizers, said there were 288,000 participants. The police had yet to release their turnout figure, which is generally lower than organizers' estimates.Less than three hours after the start of the march, police fired tear gas to try to disperse crowds that had ignored authorities' appeals to leave the area. Police said in a statement that they were clearing out the protesters, who were \"holding iron poles, self-made shields and even removing fences from roads.\"Some protesters also endangered police officers' lives by surrounding and vandalizing an occupied police vehicle, the statement added.As the demonstration rolled into the evening, officers in riot gear faced off with protesters using pieces of wood as shields. Live footage from broadcaster RTHK showed protesters on one street forcing back riot police by throwing umbrellas and waving rods at them. On another street, officers repeatedly raised warnings and fired tear gas at masked demonstrators who were standing their ground.Soon afterward, many of the protesters dispersed, but others stayed put. A group of officers appeared with batons and held up banners that read, \"Stop charging or we use force.\" At least one woman was knocked down when police used the rods.Later in the evening, protesters encircled a smashed-up car. The windows of the car were shattered and its body was covered with posters denouncing the police. It was not immediately clear who owned the vehicle or who destroyed it.By the waning hours of Saturday, some protesters remained in and around Yuen Long station. Police warned in a statement that they risked arrest.\"Police hereby reiterate that the protesters are participating in an unauthorized assembly and may be liable to a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment,\" the statement said.Late Saturday night, police wearing heavy-duty helmets and wielding batons suddenly charged into the train station, where a few hundred protesters had taken refuge from the tear gas.Some officers swung their batons directly at demonstrators, while others appeared to be urging their colleagues to hang back. For the second week in a row, blood was splattered on the station floor.A few hours before the march started, a man was arrested in Yuen Long for injuring someone with a knife, police said.Massive demonstrations began in Hong Kong early last month against an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to face trial in mainland China, where critics say their rights would be compromised. The bill was eventually suspended, but protesters' demands have grown to include direct elections, the dissolution of the current legislature and an investigation into alleged police brutality.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the framework of \"one country, two systems.\" The arrangement promises the city certain democratic freedoms that are not afforded mainland citizens, but some residents say these liberties have been steadily eroded in recent years after the arrests of booksellers and democracy activists.A distrust of China's Communist Party-led central government in Beijing has undergirded the protests this summer. After the march last weekend, a group of protesters vandalized Hong Kong's Liaison Office, which represents the mainland government. They spray-painted the building's surveillance cameras and threw eggs and black ink at the Chinese national emblem, an act that Beijing has vehemently condemned.Some Yuen Long residents participated in Saturday's march, while others stood outside with signs warning protesters not to enter. For their part, demonstrators pasted calls for democracy on sticky notes around the area.\"After the violence (last Sunday), as a resident of Yuen Long, I think I have the responsibility to come out,\" said a 24-year-old man surnamed Man. \"After all these protests in past months, the government still hasn't responded to us.\"", "INSIGHT--Chinese official urged Hong Kong villagers to drive off protesters before violence at train station,REUTERS,July,27,2019": "HONG KONG--A week before suspected triad gang members attacked protesters and commuters at a rural Hong Kong train station last Sunday, an official from China's representative office urged local residents to drive away any activists.Li Jiyi, the director of the Central Government Liaison's local district office made the appeal at a community banquet for hundreds of villagers in Hong Kong's rural New Territories.In a previously unreported recording from the July 11 event obtained by Reuters, Li addresses the large crowd about the escalating protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its worst political crisis since it returned to Chinese from British rule in 1997.Li chastises the protesters, appealing to the assembled residents to protect their towns in Yuen Long district and to chase anti-government activists away.\"We won't allow them to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble,\" he said, to a burst of applause.\"Even though there are a group of protesters trained to throw bricks and iron bars, we still have a group of Yuen Long residents with the persistence and courage to maintain social peace and protect our home.\"Repeatedly, Li spoke of the need for harmony and unity between the traditional villages and the government, \"especially when there is wind and rain in Hong Kong\".The banquet was attended by a Hong Kong government district officer, Enoch Yuen, and many of the city's rural leaders.Responding to Reuters' questions to Yuen, a spokesman for the Yuen Long district office said it had no comment on the remarks of other speakers.\"District offices would relay local information and concerns gathered to other departments, as appropriate,\" he added.Last Sunday, after anti-government protesters marched in central Hong Kong and defaced China's Liaison Office, over 100 men swarmed through Yuen Long train station, attacking black-clad protesters, passers-by, journalists and a lawmaker with pipes, clubs and lamp stands.When some protesters retaliated, the beatings escalated as men and women were hit repeatedly on their heads and bodies by the masked men, who wore white shirts.Video footage showed victims fleeing the mayhem amid screams, and floors of the train station streaked with blood. Forty-five people were injured, one critically.China's Liaison Office did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about Li's speech, and Li could not be reached for comment.In a statement on its website dated Friday, the Liaison Office rejected what it called false rumors linking it to the violence in Yuen Long, although the statement did not address Li's speech.Johnny Mak, a veteran Democratic Alliance district councilor in Yuen Long who witnessed the train station bloodshed, said he believed Li's remarks had been an explicit call to arms against protesters.\"If he didn't say this, the violence wouldn't have happened, and the triads wouldn't have beaten people,\" he told Reuters in his office close to the station.Ching Chan-ming, the head of the Shap Pat Heung rural committee which hosted the banquet that night, said he thought Li's speech was positive and held no malicious intent.\"How could he (Li) make such an appeal like that?,\" Ching told Reuters. \"I don't think it was a mobilization call. His main message is that he hopes Hong Kong can remain stable and prosperous.\"The protesters are demanding Hong Kong's leader scrap a controversial extradition law that many fear will extend China's reach into the city.The government's refusal to do so--it has agreed only to suspend the bill so far--have led to two months of sometimes violent demonstrations across the city.Beyond the extradition bill, many activists are demanding independent inquiries into the use of police force against them, and far-reaching democratic reforms--anathema to Beijing's leaders.China's Foreign Ministry Office in Hong Kong said earlier this week that \"the recent extreme and violent acts in Hong Kong have seriously undermined the foundation of the rule of law ... and trampled on the red line of \"One Country, Two Systems\" which underpins Beijing's control of Hong Kong.Two senior police sources told Reuters some of the men who attacked the protesters had triad backgrounds including from the powerful Wo Shing Wo, Hong Kong's oldest triad society, and the 14K, another large, well-known triad.Police spokespeople didn't respond to Reuters questions about triad involvement or any aspect of their operation that night.While Hong Kong's triads - ancient secret societies that morphed into mafia-style underworld operations--no longer hold the high profile of previous decades they remain entrenched in some grittier districts and in rural areas, according to police.Police told reporters in 2014 during the so-called \"Occupy\" democracy protests, that hundreds of triad members were suspected of mounting operations to infiltrate, beat and harass those in the movement. Several dozen people were arrested at the time.Within hours of Sunday's violence, police bosses battled criticism they had failed to protect the public given delays getting to the scene.Police commissioner Stephen Lo said there had been a need to \"redeploy manpower from other districts\".Democratic Party district councilor Zachary Wong said Li's message was having an impact in the days leading up to Sunday's violence and he had received repeated calls from associates a day earlier saying something was brewing.Wong said he called local police on Saturday, and then again on Sunday at 7 p.m. when he heard of men gathering in a Yuen Long park.\"Some people called me and said, 'We're really scared, please do something,\" Wong told Reuters.Both Mak and Wong said they were told by police they were aware of the situation and were handling it.During this time, pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho was filmed laughing and shaking hands with some of the men in white shirts near the park. Giving them the 'thumbs up' sign, he said: \"You are my heroes\". The men laughed and cheered in response.Ho later told reporters he had no knowledge of or involvement in the violence, but was merely reaching out to his constituents.Ho was not immediately available at his office and could not be reached on his mobile telephone.Several hours later, when the most violent assaults took place at the train station, there were still no police present to prevent the bloodshed.\"It doesn't make sense that for many hours, there wasn't a single police car in sight,\" said Mak.Two senior police officers involved in controlling demonstrations and a senior government security official told Reuters privately they were incensed at public perceptions the police somehow acted in concert with triads at Yuen Long.After the attacks in Yuen Long train station, some of the assailants fled to the traditional walled village of Nam Pin Wai nearby.There, riot police and other officers surrounded and questioned scores of men in white shirts for several hours, live media coverage showed.Sometime after 4 a.m., the men in white began to leave. No arrests were made at the time, although a dozen men have since been arrested, police said in a statement.A police commander told reporters at the scene that no arrests were made as the police could not prove the men were the assailants, and no weapons were found.Public anger over the incident has built in the days since, and tens of thousands of people are expected to march through Yuen Long on Saturday.A rare open letter signed by a group of civil servants criticized authorities' handling of the violence.\"The police's lack of response on July 21 had made people suspect the government colluded with triads,\" wrote a group of 235 civil servants from 44 government departments, including the police force.\"This had not only caused citizens to lose confidence in the police, but also made civil servants suspect that the government departments are not aimed to serve citizens faithfully.\"At a news conference, Police Commissioner Lo denied any collusion between his force and triads but acknowledged the need to restore public confidence.", "Australia says diplomats should not undermine rights, after HK protest,REUTERS,July,27,2019": "MELBOURNE--Foreign diplomats in Australia should respect the right to free speech and peaceful protest, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said, following tension between pro-Hong Kong and pro-Beijing protesters at a university.Students at Brisbane's University of Queensland gathered this week to show support for demonstrations in Hong Kong led by pro-democracy activists who object to what they see as Beijing's growing influence over the financial hub.Rival students turned up to show support for Beijing, with some playing nationalistic songs and chanting \"China is great\", media reported.

Giving them the \"thumbs up\" sign, he said: \"You are my heroes.\" The men laughed and cheered in response.Ho later told reporters he had no knowledge of or involvement in the violence, but was merely reaching out to his constituents.Ho was not immediately available at his office and could not be reached on his mobile phone.Several hours later, when the most violent assaults took place at the train station, there were still no police present to prevent the bloodshed.\"It doesn't make sense that for many hours, there wasn't a single police car in sight,\" said Mak.Two senior police officers involved in controlling demonstrations and a senior government security official told Reuters privately they were incensed at public perceptions the police somehow acted in concert with triads at Yuen Long.After the attacks in Yuen Long train station, some of the assailants fled to the traditional walled village of Nam Pin Wai nearby.There, riot police and other officers surrounded and questioned scores of men in white shirts for several hours, live media coverage showed.Sometime after 4 a.m., the men in white began to leave. No arrests were made at the time, although a dozen men have since been arrested over the incident, according to a police statement.A police commander told reporters at the scene that no arrests were made as the police couldn't prove the men were the assailants, and no weapons were found.Public anger over the incident has built in the days since, and tens of thousands of people are expected to march through Yuen Long on Saturday.A rare open letter signed by a group of civil servants criticized authorities' handling of the violence. \"The police's lack of response on July 21 had made people suspect the government colluded with triads,\" wrote a group of 235 civil servants from 44 government departments including the police force.\"This had not only caused citizens to lose confidence in the police, but also made civil servants suspect that the government departments are not aimed to serve citizens faithfully.\"At a press conference, Police Commissioner Lo denied any collusion between his force and triads but acknowledged the need to restore public confidence.", "Protesters calling for 'free Hong Kong' converge on airport,REUTERS,July,26,2019": "HONG KONG--Several hundred protesters calling for democracy and some chanting \"free Hong Kong\" converged on the Chinese-ruled city's airport on Friday as neighboring Singapore advised its citizens to avoid parts of the territory.Airport authorities said operations wouldn't be affected, but advised passengers to arrive early given the risk of disruption.The former British colony of Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997, is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades after two months of increasingly violent protests that have posed one of the gravest populist challenges to China's leader Xi Jinping since he took office.The demonstrations, mushrooming up almost daily, saw the defacement of China's main representative office last weekend, triggering warnings from Beijing this was an attack on China's sovereignty.What started as an angry response to a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed defendants to be sent to the mainland for trial, now includes demands for greater democracy, the resignation of Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and even keeping mainland Chinese tourists out of Hong Kong.Some protesters, dressed in helmets and seated on the ground of the arrivals hall, held up signs calling on the government to withdraw the extradition bill completely, while chants of \"Free Hong Kong\" reverberated around the building.\"The world has been watching us in the past few weeks,\" said Jeremy Tam, a former pilot and lawmaker who helped organize the protest with other aviation sector employees.\"We simply believe that the airport is the most direct way for all tourists to explain what is happening in Hong Kong.\"Singapore urged its citizens in a travel advisory on Friday to avoid parts of Hong Kong where protests may be taking place, noting the airport demonstration.\"If you are already in Hong Kong, you should take all necessary precautions to ensure your personal safety,\" it read.\"Protests which are meant to be peaceful may still have the potential to turn violent with little or no notice.\"Some protesters handed out flyers explaining the city's crisis to tourists.Others condemned the failure of police to protect citizens and protesters from a frenzied attack by armed men at a train station last Sunday that shocked the city. Police sources say some of these men had triad backgrounds.Members of the public, tourists and pilots, flight attendants and other aviation workers signed a petition urging the Hong Kong government to prosecute the attackers.The Flight Attendants' Union for Hong Kong's main carrier Cathay Pacific had earlier urged its members to \"stand up for our human rights and be connected with the rest of the HongKongers\" on its Facebook page.\"United Hong Kong Stands!\" it added.An investment banker at a U.S. bank told Reuters he had rescheduled his flight from Hong Kong to Beijing to another day, over concerns flights possibly being grounded should the protest escalate.", "Hong Kong anti-government protests spill into soccer game,REUTERS,July,25,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong soccer fans sang protest songs and waved anti-government banners as politics spilled into the sporting arena on Wednesday during a friendly game involving English Premier League champions Manchester City in the China-ruled city.Before the game, a few protesters handed out fliers outside the stadium where Man City played local outfit Kitchee.\"We must protest. We are many,\" said one protester, who covered his face and declined to be named, as police nearby marshaled fans into the stadium.Over past months, Hong Kong has been embroiled by a series of sometimes violent protests--its most serious crisis since the city was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 but with democratic freedoms under a \"one country, two systems\" formula.Fresh conflicts broke out on Sunday in a widening crisis over an extradition bill that could see people from the territory sent to China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.Once Wednesday's game was under way, some fans sang \"Can you hear the people sing?\" and many in the 20,000 crowd began chanting \"Free Hong Kong.\"Others held up \"No Extradition\" signs calling on the Hong Kong government to categorically scrap the extradition bill rather than merely suspend it as they have done now.One man dressed in black, the preferred color worn by protesters, also ran onto the pitch, briefing disrupting the match towards the end.Manchester City easily won the game 6-1, including two goals from winger Leroy Sane, on a hot and humid night.Also on the scoresheet were David Silva, Raheem Sterling, Nabil Touaizi and Iker Pozo in front of a disappointing turnout of just under 21,000 at Hong Kong Stadium.City manager Pep Guardiola had earlier said protests affected him at a human level. The former Barcelona coach was born in the Spanish region of Catalonia, and has been a staunch supporter of its push for independence from Spain.\"Always in society we have to accept protests,\" Guardiola was quoted as saying by local media.Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 amid promises it would be granted a high degree of autonomy. But Beijing's increasingly tight control of the city has stoked discontent and protests. Some have even called for a split from China.In a post-match news conference, Guardiola said he hoped a solution could be found to Hong Kong's problems. \"Here the game was normal,\" he added, saying his players were unaffected.Kitchee's captain, Huang Yang, said he hoped football could help ease tensions. \"We use football to unite people, getting together and (to) see a future in Hong Kong.\"Manchester City's Asia tour has been more notable for what happened off the pitch than on it. Firstly, they arrived in China two days later than scheduled for the Premier League Asia Trophy due to an \"unforeseen administrative issue.\"After losing in the final of the four-team tournament to Wolverhampton Wanderers on penalties on Saturday, Guardiola, his players and the club as a whole were criticized by Chinese state media outlet Xinhua for their \"attitude of arrogance.\"City can expect a less eventful finale to their Asia tour on Saturday, when they take on Japanese side Yokohama F Marinos--an outfit part-owned by City Football Group--before returning to Manchester ahead of their Aug. 4 meeting with Liverpool in the Community Shield.They then kick off the defense of their Premier League title on Aug. 10 away to West Ham United, with the Spaniard admitting preparations have been far from ideal.\"I would have preferred another way, but it is what it is,\" he said. \"Now it's always like this: going to the States or going to Asia, always traveling and sometimes not perfect conditions, but we adapt. The players accept that.\"", "China says some Hong Kong protester actions 'intolerable',THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,25,2019": "BEIJING--China's Defense Ministry pointed Wednesday to an article in Hong Kong law that allows the army to step in upon request during public security incidents, as tumult in the city amid summer-long protests has fueled fears that the military will intervene.In answering a question at a news briefing about how the ministry will respond to rising \"independence forces\" in the Chinese territory, ministry spokesman Wu Qian did not explicitly state what might happen, but pointed to Article 14 of Hong Kong's Garrison Law.The article stipulates that Hong Kong's government may ask for assistance from Chinese military troops stationed in the city \"in the maintenance of public order\" or in disaster relief. If the central government approves the request for help, the troops will perform the tasks and return to their stations once they are completed, the article says.\"The behavior of some radical demonstrators challenging the authority of the central government and touching the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle is absolutely intolerable,\" Wu said.Hong Kong residents have taken to the streets in droves since early last month to protest an extradition bill and call for democratic reforms. After the end of a pro-democracy march that drew more than 100,000 people on Sunday, some demonstrators directed their ire at the Liaison Office, which represents China's Communist Party-led central government in Hong Kong.The protesters threw eggs and splattered black ink at the Chinese national emblem on the building facade--acts that Beijing condemned as \"violent.\"A former British colony, Hong Kong is a territory that was returned to China in 1997. The \"one country, two systems\" principle promises the city certain freedoms not afforded mainland citizens, but Hong Kong residents say their liberties have been steadily eroding in recent years as Beijing's role in its affairs has grown.", "China warns of war if Taiwan makes move to independence,REUTERS,July,25,2019": "BEIJING--China warned on Wednesday it was ready for war if there was any move toward Taiwan's independence, accusing the United States of undermining global stability and denouncing its arms sales to the self-ruled island.This month, the United States approved sales of weapons requested by Taiwan, including tanks and Stinger missiles, estimated to be worth $2.2 billion (238 billion yen).China responded by saying it would impose sanctions on U.S. firms involved in any deals.Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian told a news briefing on a defense white paper, the first like it in several years to outline the military's strategic concerns, that China would make its greatest effort for peaceful reunification with Taiwan.\"However, we must firmly point out that seeking Taiwan independence is a dead end,\" Wu said.\"If there are people who dare to try to split Taiwan from the country, China's military will be ready to go to war to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,\" he said.A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said Washington remained committed to a \"one-China\" policy, under which Washington officially recognizes Beijing and not Taipei, while assisting Taiwan.He said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a consistent policy of multiple U.S. administrations and had contributed to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\"The United States considers any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, of grave concern to the United States,\" he added.The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a wayward province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.While Washington has no formal ties with democratic Taiwan, it is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.The Chinese ministry said the United States had \"provoked intensified competition among major countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure ... and undermined global strategic stability.\"Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said later in a statement that Beijing's \"provocative behavior ... seriously violated the peace principle in international laws and relations, challenging regional safety and order.\"\"We urge Beijing authorities to renounce irrational, malicious acts such as the use of force, and to improve cross-strait relations and handle issues including Hong Kong rationally, so that it can be a responsible regional member,\" it said.In Beijing, asked how China's military would handle escalating protest violence in Hong Kong's widening crisis over a contentious extradition bill, Wu referred only to the territory's garrison law, which he said \"already has a clear stipulation.\"That law states that the Hong Kong government can request the People's Liberation Army (PLAN) garrison's assistance to maintain public order.But legal scholars say it is a very high threshold, and some retired security officials say any involvement by PLAN units in Hong Kong security would shatter the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which the former British colony returned to China in 1997.Wu also said reports of a secret pact with Cambodia granting China's armed forces exclusive access to part of the Southeast Asian nation's Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand were \"not in accordance with the facts.\"\"China and Cambodia have in the past carried out positive exchanges and cooperation on military drills, personnel training and logistics,\" he said. \"This kind of cooperation does not target any third party.\"", "Hong Kong arrests men with gang links over mob attack,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,24,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police say they've arrested six men, some with links to triad gangs, following a violent attack on pro-democracy protesters at a subway station over the weekend that saw dozens injured.Senior police official Chan Tin-chu said the men, aged 24-54, were held for \"unlawful assembly\" and are being investigated for taking part in the attack late Sunday night. Some of them are villagers, and their occupations range from drivers and hawkers to renovation workers, he said.\"Some of them have triad backgrounds,\" he said. \"I believe that more ... will be detained soon. Police will not condone any form of violence.\"Police are still investigating the motive for the attack, Chan said, without providing further details on the alleged links to the triads, which refer to powerful organized crime syndicates in Hong Kong. The triads control certain neighborhoods in the city and are believed to have strong political influence.A gang of white-clad men armed with metal rods and wooden poles beat up anti-government protesters and others inside a subway station in Hong Kong's Yuen Long neighborhood late Sunday, injuring 45 people, including a man who remained in critical condition.More than 100,000 people took part in the latest rally in the city earlier that day to demand democracy and an investigation into the use of force by police to disperse crowds at the summer-long protests. Some protesters on Sunday directed their ire at China, pelting its office in Hong Kong with eggs, spray-painting a wall and defacing the Chinese national emblem.As demonstrators made their way home, the white-clad men descended on a group of them at the subway station. Videos showed them charging into the trains and beating up people who tried to defend themselves with umbrellas.Police have come under fire for being slow to respond to the violence against the protesters. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said police were stretched thin due to the massive crowds and denied accusations that her government colluded with the assailants.The assault escalated a crisis that had thrown the former British colony into turmoil after millions of people took to the streets in waves of protest against an extradition bill that would send suspects for trial in China. Critics see it as rising Chinese influence and fear it will chip away at Hong Kong's freedoms promised under a \"one country, two system\" formula since it returned to China in 1997.More protests have been planned, but the latest violence has fueled fears that China's People's Liberation Army may intervene.", "Li Peng, Chinese premier during Tiananmen crackdown, dies,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,24,2019": "BEIJING--Li Peng, a former hard-line Chinese premier best known for announcing martial law during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests that ended with a bloody crackdown by troops, has died. He was 90.China's official Xinhua News Agency said Li died Monday of an unspecified illness. His death was not announced until Tuesday evening.Li, a keen political infighter, spent two decades at the pinnacle of power before retiring in 2002. He left behind a legacy of prolonged and broad-based economic growth coupled with authoritarian political controls.While broadly disliked by the public, he oversaw China's reemergence from post-Tiananmen isolation to rising global diplomatic and economic clout, a development he celebrated in public statements that often were defiantly nationalistic.\"Ridding themselves from the predicament of imperialist bullying, humiliation and oppression, the calamity-trodden Chinese people have since stood up,\" Li said in 1995 in a speech for the Oct. 1 anniversary of the 1949 revolution that brought the ruling Communist Party to power.One reminder of Li will likely stand for ages to come: During his final years in power, he pushed through approval for his pet project \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the gargantuan $22 billion Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which forced 1.3 million people to leave homes that were swallowed up by its enormous reservoir.Li, who became acting premier in November 1987, triumphed over pro-reform party leader Zhao Ziyang in 1989 after the fellow native of Sichuan province was toppled from power for sympathizing with the student protesters at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\"The situation will not develop as you wish and expect,\" an angry Li told student leaders in a confrontational meeting on May 18, 1989.The next night, Li, flushed with anger, went on national television to announce martial law in Beijing.\"The anarchic state is going from bad to worse,\" he said. \"We are forced to take resolute and decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil.\"On the night of June 3-4, troops invaded the city, killing hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Beijing residents on their way to ending the student occupation of Tiananmen Square.China acknowledged Li's role, but in a positive way, in a lengthy eulogy read Tuesday night by a newscaster on state broadcaster CCTV.Li joined the majority of the leadership in taking \"resolute measures to prevent turmoil, quell the counter-revolutionary riots and stabilize the domestic situation,\" the eulogy read in part. \"He played an important role in the great struggle that concerns the future and destiny of the party and the nation.\"Li stepped down as premier in 1998, becoming chairman of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. He retired from the party's seven-member ruling Standing Committee in 2002 as part of a long-planned handover of power to a younger generation of leaders headed by Hu Jintao.In his later years, Li rarely appeared in public, and was usually seen only at official gatherings aimed at displaying unity, such as the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army in 2007.As his profile waned, he reportedly began lobbying older colleagues to support his children's political ambitions. One of his two sons, Li Xiaopeng, was the governor of Shanxi province before becoming transport minister in 2016.Li returned to the headlines in 2010 when a Hong Kong publisher announced he had Li's purported memoir on the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The publisher later halted the book's release, claiming copyright problems, but supposed excerpts of the diaries were leaked online.A cautious and uninspiring figure, Li was one of the few leaders to inspire real dislike among the nation's masses, although he was said to inspire loyalty among his subordinates.Born in October 1928 in Chengdu, a city in southwestern China, he was adopted by the late Premier Zhou Enlai after Li's father, an early communist revolutionary, was killed by the rival Nationalists in 1931.He shrugged off questions of nepotism, saying he was one of many war orphans cared for by Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao. But he did say that \"their ideals and moral influence had a profound influence on my upbringing.\"Li joined the Communist Party in 1945 after joining Zhou, Mao Zedong and others at their wartime guerrilla base of Yan'an in the northwest.After spending six years as an engineering student in Moscow, Li worked as an engineer for a decade in northeastern China.He was named director of the Beijing Electric Power Administration in 1966, and according to official biographies, was responsible for ensuring a stable power supply to Beijing and Tianjin during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.Li headed what was called the \"power industry family.\" His daughter Li Xiaolin was a prominent figure in the state power sector. Her retirement as CEO of China Power International Development in 2015 was seen by some as part of current Chinese President Xi Jinping's moves to uproot leaders' children from highly visible positions in the state sector.Li rose quickly after 1979, and in 1985 became a member of the party's decision-making Politburo with an education portfolio.It was in that role that he established himself as a conservative, telling students in 1985 that China can never become capitalist: \"To allow bourgeois freedoms would only make our country's affairs chaotic.\"His tough stance when students staged pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities in late 1986 and early 1987 helped him win a post on the powerful Politburo Standing Committee, leading to his showdown with the reform-minded Zhao over Tiananmen in 1989.", "Hong Kong crisis escalates after mob attack on protesters,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,23,2019": "HONG KONG--An overnight attack by white-clad assailants apparently targeting pro-democracy protesters raised tensions to new levels in Hong Kong on Monday as China harshly criticized the weekend demonstration, saying \"central authority cannot be challenged.\"The Chinese rebuke came after its Hong Kong office was targeted Sunday night by protesters who pelted it with eggs and spray-painted its walls. It made no mention of the violent attack hours later at a subway station by men wielding iron pipes and wooden poles as they beat up people clad in the pro-democracy movement's black shirts. Dozens were injured.The attack on China's Liaison Office was an escalation of the weekslong protests, during which demonstrators besieged Hong Kong's legislature and police headquarters but did not direct their ire at China itself. It came after more than 100,000 people marched through the city to demand democracy and an investigation into the use of force by police to disperse crowds at protests.As demonstrators made their way home, a gang of men descended on a group of them at a subway station. Video of the attack in Hong Kong's Yuen Long neighborhood showed the protesters being beaten by the assailants as they retreated into the trains, intimidated by the gangs of men waiting for them outside the turnstiles. The attackers then entered the trains and beat the people inside as they tried to defend themselves with umbrellas.At least 45 people were injured, and 15 remained hospitalized Monday afternoon, including one man in critical condition, the Hospital Authority said.Subway passengers filmed by Stand News and iCABLE angrily accused police officers of not intervening to protect the demonstrators, who have been critical of the police use of force.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Monday that allegations that police had colluded with the assailants were \"unfounded.\"The Sunday night assault on Beijing's Hong Kong Liaison Office touched a raw nerve in China. China's national emblem, which hangs on the front of the building, was splattered with black ink. It was replaced by a new one within hours.The official People's Daily newspaper, in a front-page commentary on Monday headlined \"Central Authority Cannot Be Challenged,\" called the protesters' actions \"intolerable.\"\"These acts openly challenged the authority of the central government and touched the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,\" the government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said in a statement Sunday.Lam repeated the same statement to reporters Monday, adding that the vandalism \"hurt the nation's feelings.\"The \"one country, two systems\" framework, under which the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, allows Hong Kong to maintain a fair degree of autonomy in local affairs. Demonstrators fear the pro-Beijing government in Hong Kong is chipping away at their rights and freedoms, and the weekslong tumult has fueled fears of a more aggressive Chinese response.In Washington, President Donald Trump said he believes Chinese leader Xi Jinping has acted \"very responsibly\" in allowing the extended protests to play out in Hong Kong. Asked about China's handling of the protests, he said that \"China could stop them if they wanted.\"\"I hope that President Xi will do the right thing. But it has been going on a long time,\" Trump added, without elaborating.Meanwhile, a group of pro-China lawmakers held a news conference appealing for a halt to the violence, saying it was a blow to Hong Kong's reputation and was scaring away tourists and investors.They also urged police to tighten enforcement against the protesters, whom Regina Ip, a former security secretary, called \"rebels.\"\"The violent attack on the Liaison Office ... is a direct affront to the sovereignty of our country,\" Ip said.Asked why it took at least a half-hour for police to arrive at the suburban train station where protesters were attacked, she said the police were \"overstretched.\"\"The police have been under extreme pressure,\" she said.Later Monday, the office of a pro-Beijing lawmaker was surrounded and vandalized by about 100 people who believed he had shaken hands the previous day with the attackers. Protesters wrote memos and stuck them on legislator Junius Ho's office, damaged glass panels at the entrance and destroyed a surveillance camera. No one appeared to be in the office.Meanwhile, pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said the Sunday night subway attack showed \"more than apparent\" involvement from the triad, a branch of organized crime in Hong Kong.\"What happened last night doesn't seem accidental in any way,\" Mo said. \"It's all organized.\"The growing crisis in Hong Kong has fueled fears that China's People's Liberation Army may intervene.A Chinese army brigade said Monday that it held an anti-terrorism exercise in southern Guangdong province. The 74th Army Group did not refer to Hong Kong in its social media statement, but military commentator and retired officer Yue Gang said that troops would be dispatched to the semi-autonomous territory if needed.\"To deface the Chinese national emblem is like acting as an enemy to 1.3 billion Chinese people,\" Yue said. \"They must be deterred.\"Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the nationalistic Global Times, warned against military intervention.\"If the People's Liberation Army helps to stabilize the situation, Hong Kong will benefit from law and order, but the public opinion won't buy it,\" Hu wrote in a commentary published on Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging service.

Some are also demanding full democracy - anathema to Beijing's party leadership.On Sunday, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse activists after thousands had ringed Beijing's Liaison Office.The police said in statement that protesters hurled bricks, smoke grenades and petrol bombs during the unrest that came after hundreds of thousands marched through the city streets.The Chinese government, including office director Wang Zhimin, condemned the turmoil, which included spray-painting and hurling eggs at walls and a national emblem at the office, saying the behaviour challenged the \"authority and dignity\" of the Chinese government.A foreign ministry spokesman said such acts tested Beijing's limits.\"Some radical protestor behaviour violated our bottom line of 'one country, two systems'. We cannot tolerate that,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.The unrest in Hong Kong marks the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.", "China lashes out at Hong Kong protest targeting its office,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,22,2019": "HONG KONG--China on Monday harshly criticized a demonstration in which eggs were thrown at its office in Hong Kong and messages spray-painted on the exterior walls.The official People's Daily newspaper, in a front-page commentary headlined \"Central Authority Cannot be Challenged,\" called the protesters' actions \"intolerable.\"One group of protesters targeted China's liaison office on Sunday night after more than 100,000 people marched through the city to demand democracy and an investigation into the use of force by police to disperse crowds at earlier protests.Police launched tear gas to disperse the protesters.

It was replaced by a new one within hours.Police said on their official social media accounts that protesters threw bricks and petrol bombs at them and attacked the Central police station.\"These acts openly challenged the authority of the central government and touched the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,\" the government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said in a statement issued Sunday.The \"one-country, two systems\" framework allows Hong Kong to maintain a fair amount of autonomy in governing local affairs, but demonstrators fear the city's rights and freedoms are being eroded.A group of pro-China lawmakers held a news conference Monday appealing for a halt to the violence, saying it was a blow to Hong Kong's reputation and is scaring away tourists and investors.They also urged police to tighten enforcement against the protesters, whom Ip labels as \"rebels.\"\"The violent attack on the Liaison Office ... is a direct affront to the sovereignty of our country,\" said Regina Ip, a former security secretary.When asked why it took at least a half-hour for police to arrive at the suburban train station and intervene, Ip said the police were \"overstretched.\"\"The police have been under extreme pressure,\" she said.Video of the attacks in Yuen Long showed protesters in black shirts being beaten by men in white shirts wielding steel pipes and wooden poles. Those under attack retreated into the trains, intimidated by the gangs of men waiting for them outside the turnstiles. The attackers then entered the trains and beat the people inside as they tried to defend themselves with umbrellas. They eventually retreated.One of the men in white held up a sign saying \"Protect Yuen Long, protect our homes.\"Subway passengers filmed by Stand News and iCABLE angrily accused police officers of not intervening in the attack.

They then headed for the Liaison Office, which represents China's Communist Party-led central government within the city.Protesters threw eggs at the building and spray-painted its surrounding surveillance cameras. China's national emblem, which adorns the front of the Liaison Office, was splattered with black ink. The Liaison Office said in comments published on Chinese state media that the acts \"openly challenged the authority of the central government and touched the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle.\"Later, police threw tear gas canisters at protesters to try to disperse them. Protesters scattered, some heading back in the direction of a key business and retail district. Police remained in place, protecting themselves with shields.

Nearby, activists daubed graffiti on massive concrete pillars leading up to it, with the words \"Restore Hong Kong, Revolution of Time.\"Sunday's protest, which had proceeded peacefully along the police-mandated route, is the latest in a wave of unrest that has plunged the Asian financial hub into political crisis.Some held up banners that said, \"LIAR\" and \"No excuse Carrie Lame.\" A poster plastered on a lamppost called for an \"Investigation on police brutality.\"Many ignored the official end-point of the rally as the demonstrations show no sign of let-up, posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.Authorities used blue and white water-filled barriers to barricade government and police headquarters, while global bank HSBC, in a rare move, pulled down large metal barriers on the street level of its gleaming skyscraper building.While most of the rallies have passed off peacefully, some have erupted into violence late at night when more radical protesters have clashed with police.The city's police force has come under scrutiny after officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas last month to disperse demonstrators in some of the worst violence to roil Hong Kong in decades.The police are struggling to cope amid haphazard decision-making, worsening morale and anger among rank-and-file officers that they are taking the public heat for government unpopularity, serving and retired officers, politicians and security analysts told Reuters.The latest protest comes a day after tens of thousands gathered to voice support for the police, whom some have accused of using excessive force against activists, and demand an end to the violence.Sunday's march focused on calls for the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, which would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial, and an independent investigation into complaints of police brutality.Other demands include charges against protesters to be dropped and universal suffrage.\"I came back to Hong Kong this summer because of the protests,\" said Mandy Ko, 27, who is originally from Hong Kongand now lives in Australia.\"My spirit is still with Hong Kong people.\"Last weekend, two initially peaceful protests degenerated into running skirmishes between baton-wielding police and activists, resulting in scores of injuries and more than 40 arrests.Those fights followed larger outbreaks of violence in central Hong Kong last month, when police forced back activists with tear gas, rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds.Lam has apologised for the turmoil the extradition bill has caused and declared it \"dead.\" Opponents of the bill, which they fear could be used to silence dissent, say nothing short of its withdrawal will do.Under the terms of the handover from Britain in 1997, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.But for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.The protests have at times paralysed parts of the financial district, shut government offices and disrupted business operations across the city. Officials have also warned about the impact of the unrest on the economy.A commentary published in the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper on Sunday said: \"If violence continues, it will inevitably deal a greater blow to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.\"China has condemned the violent protests as an \"undisguised challenge\" to the one country, two systems formula.Police late on Friday seized explosives and weapons in an industrial building in the New Territories district of Tsuen Wan.

China also claims Taiwan as its territory, though the democratically governed island split from the Communist Party-ruled mainland amid civil war in 1949.Tsai spoke to reporters during a visit this week to Saint Lucia, an eastern Caribbean island nation that is among Taiwan's few remaining allies.

That protest was mostly peaceful but ended in mayhem when violent scuffles in a shopping mall saw dozens injured, including a policeman who had a finger bitten off, and over 40 people detained.Veteran actress and singer Deanie Ip, who joined Wednesday's demonstration, said police shouldn't use heavy-handed tactics against young protesters who \"have no guns\" and were peacefully expressing their frustrations.\"They are young people and they are doing the right thing. Why are they being mistreated?\" she said.Ip and several others held a banner reading \"Support youth to protect Hong Kong\" as they marched through a financial district. Wearing white tops and black pants, marchers held placards that read \"Never give up\" and \"Stay together.\"Dozens of seniors carried a 6-meter-long black banner that read \"Reject tyrannical rule.\"Some elders in wheelchairs also joined the march. Organizers said about 8,000 people participated in the demonstration.Hong Kong has been jolted for over a month by a series of large-scale and occasional violent protests amid widespread anger over a proposed extradition law that would send suspects to mainland China to face trials. The bill is seen as a threat to Hong Kong's freedoms that were guaranteed for 50 years when China took back control of the former British colony in 1997.Even though Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, suspended the bill and declared the legislation \"dead,\" her moves failed to placate the protesters, who have demanded her resignation. Tens of thousands have continued to take to the streets, with the protests expanding into a bigger movement against China's growing intrusion into the territory.The senior citizens Wednesday repeated demands for the legislation to be formally withdrawn, for the release of dozens of people detained and for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters.More protests have been planned, which could cause further instability in the global financial hub.Phil Chan, a senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm, said violent clashes between protesters and police could intensify unless the government starts to engage meaningfully with the people in meeting some of their demands, including the move toward universal suffrage.\"The government at present is merely engaging in verbal dissemblance,\" Chan said. \"As the political crisis drags on, it will become increasingly difficult for the Hong Kong government to resolve, and police-community relations will take a long time to heal.

Each time he felt the now-familiar sting, Wong, 18, was more determined to not back down.\"Every time we come out and stand up, problems continue to arise afterward,\" Wong said, referring to the protesters' dissatisfaction with responses from law enforcement and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. \"Trust in the whole Hong Kong government is bankrupt.\"What began as a protest against an extradition bill has ballooned into a fundamental challenge to the way Hong Kong is governed--and the role of the Chinese government in the city's affairs. \"Hong Kong is not China\" has become a refrain of the movement in what is a Chinese territory, but with its own laws and a separate legal system under a \"one country, two systems\" framework.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Hong Kong in three marches last month to oppose the extradition legislation, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China, where critics fear they would face opaque charges and unfair trials.In recent weeks, the demonstrations have also included two smaller protests led by nativist-leaning groups against an influx of mainland Chinese into the city of 7.4 million people. All of it traces back to an underlying mistrust of the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities, which fuels calls for a more responsive government that protesters believe democracy would bring.When Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997, its residents were promised certain freedoms not afforded to mainland Chinese. Opponents of the extradition bill argued that a hallmark of the \"one country, two systems\" framework--Hong Kong's independent judicial system--would be compromised under the proposed legislation.Lam initially maintained that the bill would move forward, but has since declared them indefinitely suspended and \"dead.\" The protests, however, have continued unabated, as demonstrators call for Lam's resignation, the legislation's formal withdrawal and an investigation into police tactics. They also demand that protesters not be punished--as the leaders of the pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement\" demonstrations in 2014 were.Across these issues, protesters have increasingly held up signs expressing a broader wish: a yearning for greater democracy.Slogans such as \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Democracy Now\" have become more widely used, said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of a book about the city's recent protest history who has been attending the protests since they began.\"People are fundamentally saying that they don't trust the mainland Communist government,\" he said. \"There's an underlying anxiety and fear in Hong Kong of what they're going to do.\"Pro-democracy sentiment has become more pronounced in recent years as Hong Kong residents increasingly feel that Beijing, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is encroaching on their promised freedoms.A principal demand has been for \"universal suffrage,\" which means allowing Hong Kong citizens to vote directly for their chief executive and Legislative Council. The current chief executive, Lam, was chosen in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.Several events have fueled anxieties about eroding boundaries between Hong Kong and the mainland. Five Hong Kong booksellers disappeared and ended up in Chinese custody, and the 2014 protest leaders were sent to prison. Meanwhile, China has built a high-speed rail link between the mainland and Hong Kong and plans to include both in a \"Greater Bay Area,\" seen as attempts by Beijing to meld Hong Kong with the mainland.\"The furor over the extradition bill has since metamorphosed into a generalized movement uniting Hong Kong people of all ages and from all walks of life to express their frustrations and disappointments about an array of issues related to China,\" said Phil Chan, a senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm.Mainland Chinese traders, as well as middle-aged mainland women who sing and dance loudly in a public park, have also been targets of Hong Kong protesters.In what has become a recurring pattern, a demonstration Sunday in the northern district of Sha Tin was peaceful for most of the day, but scuffles broke out when police started clearing streets after nightfall. Some protesters retreated into a shopping complex where they and police hit each other with clubs and umbrellas. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, described the clashes as an \"eye-for-an-eye retaliatory\" approach.Wong was in the area Sunday, trying to help fellow protesters find safety. He said they are now gearing up for a large protest this Sunday at the government complex in the Admiralty district.\"There is a reason that all of these citizens are standing up,\" said Wong, a recent high school graduate who plans to study design at university in the fall. \"We still have to work, we still have to study, we would like to have normal holidays.\"Instead, he has spent his summer break administering first aid to protesters and helping to document the events.\"I just can't imagine how this will end,\" he said.", "Hong Kong leader thanks police after clashes with \u00e2\u0080\u0098rioters\u00e2\u0080\u0099,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam thanked police on Monday after violent scuffles erupted between law enforcement officers and protesters demanding her resignation.A demonstration Sunday in Hong Kong's Sha Tin district was peaceful for most of the day, but fights broke out when police started clearing streets after nightfall.

And yet we've all seen the changes. I myself am already 70-something years old. What do I know about politics? But politics comes to you.\"Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees its people freedoms for 50 years that are not enjoyed in mainland China, including the liberty to protest and an independent judiciary.Beijing denies interfering in Hong Kong affairs, but many residents worry about what they see as an erosion of those freedoms and a relentless march toward mainland control.Millions have taken to the streets over the past month in some of the largest and most violent protests in decades over an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has said the bill is \"dead\", but opponents say they will settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal.Some protesters at Sunday's event waved banners appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to \"Please liberate Hong Kong\" and \"Defend our Constitution\".Some marchers beat drums, while others waved British and American flags, with banners calling for independence for Hong Kong flying from makeshift flagpoles.Chants of \"Carrie Lam go to hell,\" rang through the crowd.The protests have fuelled the former British colony's biggest political crisis since China regained control of Hong Kong, and pose a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.\"I never missed a march so far since June,\" said a 69-year-old man who gave only his surname, Chen, referring to the wave of protests.\"I support the youngsters, they have done something we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done. There is nothing we can do to help them, but come out and march to show our appreciation and support.\"Critics see the now-suspended extradition bill as a threat to the rule of law. Protesters are also demanding that Lam step down and want an independent investigation into complaints of police brutality.One woman, in her mid-50s, said protesters had harassed her after she tried to defend the police, whom activists described as \"dogs\".\"It's verbal violence,\" said the woman, who gave her name only as Catherine. \"People just surrounded me and shouted rude language and that makes me feel I am living in fear.\"On Saturday, a largely peaceful demonstration in a town close to the Chinese border turned violent as protesters hurled umbrellas and hardhats at police, who retaliated by swinging batons and firing pepper spray.The government condemned violence during Saturday's protests against so-called \"parallel traders\" from the mainland who buy goods in bulk in Hong Kong, to carry into China for profit.It said that during the last 18 months it had arrested 126 mainland visitors suspected of infringing the terms of their stay by engaging in parallel trading, and barred about 5,000 mainland Chinese also suspected of involvement.Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of journalists joined a silent march to demand better treatment from police at protests.", "Hong Kong protesters march near border to target traders from China,REUTERS,July,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Several thousand Hong Kong people marched on Saturday to protest against mainland Chinese traders in a border town, tapping into sentiment behind huge demonstrations against an extradition bill to highlight another problem they see as having been mismanaged.The protest in the town of Sheung Shui is the latest in a string of demonstrations that has roiled the former British colony for more than a month, fueling its biggest political crisis since China regained control in 1997.Street protests have drawn in millions, with hundreds even storming the legislature on July 1 to oppose the now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial.Critics see the bill as a threat to Hong Kong's rule of law. Chief Executive Carrie Lam this week said the bill was \"dead\" after having suspended it last month, but opponents vow to settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal.Most protests centered on the central business district, but demonstrators have recently begun to look elsewhere to widen support by taking up narrower, more domestic issues.\"Our lovely town has become chaos,\" said Ryan Lai, 50, a resident of Sheung Shui, where so-called \"parallel traders\" buy bulk quantities of duty-free goods to be carried into mainland China and sold.\"We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to stop travel and buying, but please, just make it orderly and legal,\" he added. \"The extradition bill was the tipping point for us to come out. We want Sheung Shui back.\"Mainland traders have long been a source of anger among those in Hong Kong who say they have fueled inflation, driven up property prices, dodged taxes and diluted the town's identity.Hundreds of police patrolled nearby streets as protesters chanted demands in Mandarin, China's official language, for the traders to go home. Many street-level shops were shuttered ahead of the march.\"We want to raise awareness in Washington that the United States has to do more now to help Hong Kong become fully democratic,\" said a resident of the nearby town of Fanling, who was one of five people in the crowd carrying U.S. flags.\"They are the most important power left that can stand up to China,\" added the 30-year-old man, who gave his name only as David, declining to reveal his surname.Hong Kong's lack of full democracy was behind the recent unrest, said Jimmy Sham, of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized protests against the extradition bill.\"The government, Carrie Lam, some legislators in functional constituencies are not elected by the people, so there are many escalating actions in different districts to reflect different social issues,\" he said.\"If political problems are not solved, social well-being issues will continue to emerge endlessly.\"Similar protests have included a march last week by nearly 2,000 people in the Tuen Mun residential district to protest against what they saw as the nuisance of brash singing and dancing to Mandarin pop songs by middle-aged mainland women.On Sunday, tens of thousands marched in one of Kowloon's most popular tourist shopping areas, trying to persuade mainland Chinese tourists to back opposition to the extradition bill.When former colonial ruler Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Chinese Communist leaders promised the city a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.But many say China has progressively tightened its grip, putting Hong Kong's freedoms under threat through a range of measures such as the extradition bill.Anti-extradition protesters plan another demonstration on Sunday in the town of Sha Tin, in the so-called New Territories between Hong Kong island and the border with China.", "Hong Kong protests augur murky outlook for financial hub,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,13,2019": "HONG KONG--It's still the world's \"freest\" economy, one of the biggest global financial centers and a scenic haven for tycoons and tourists, but the waves of protests rocking Hong Kong are exposing strains unlikely to dissipate as communist-ruled Beijing's influence grows.The end of the former British colony's 50-year grace period after China took control in 1997 is years away, and the protests have made only a minor dent in day-to-day business. But they point to issues clouding the outlook, as investors and residents fret that the city will lose its Western-style freedoms.Many in Hong Kong believe their future hinges on keeping the civil liberties, independent courts and other advantages Beijing promised to preserve for at least a half-century after Britain ceded control under an arrangement dubbed \"one-country, two systems.\"\"We're still talking about 28 years,\" says Grant Strudwick, vice president for Asia for Pinkerton, which provides risk management services. \"The spotlight is on China as to how they treat this transition period.\"Hong Kong's economy once was about a fifth the size of China's. Now, it's a tiny fraction of that, thanks in no small part to an industrial boom driven by Hong Kong tycoons who set up factories across the border after China opened to outside investment in the 1970s.The territory's success as a center for trade and investment is grounded in its independent legal system and the free flow of information, said Joseph Cheng, a political analyst and leader of a pro-democracy coalition, the Alliance for True Democracy.\"These are two important assets enabling Hong Kong to have a distinct edge over major coastal cities in China, like Shanghai, like Shenzhen,\" he said.He believes that, without further moves toward democracy, Hong Kong will likely become more unstable.Confidence in the \"one country, two systems\" experiment was already feeble when the top local leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, put forward legislation that would allow authorities to send suspects held in Hong Kong to face trial in mainland Chinese courts that provide no assurances of independent judges, due process and other Western legal protections.As tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents took to the streets in protests and business groups and foreign governments registered their concerns, Lam suspended the proposed legislation. Pro-democracy activists have pressed on with the protests, demanding she permanently withdraw the bill, order an independent inquiry into heavy-handed police tactics and resign.On Tuesday, Lam insisted that the extradition bill was \"dead.\" Hong Kong's government also issued a statement saying it doesn't plan to implement the \"social credit\" system used in the mainland to penalize and reward behavior measured using various technologies including data processing and facial recognition that critics have described as Orwellian.Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, though some have turned violent. Protesters vandalized the local legislative building earlier this month. Such sights might deter some investors, but they also show the city is a world apart from the rest of China, where public dissent is banned.The protests are \"part of the checks and balances in place in Hong Kong that support institutional strength,\" the ratings agency Moody's said in a recent update.The conservative think tank Heritage Foundation has ranked Hong Kong the \"freest economy\" for 25 straight years. The city is the No. 3 financial center, according to an international survey of bankers, behind New York and London. It plays a pivotal role in financing for China and was the top location for initial public offerings in 2018, with nearly $37 billion raised.As small as it is relative to China as a whole, Hong Kong retains an outsized strategic role for Beijing, says Ken Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings.If trade tensions between the U.S. and China worsen further, leading Washington to curb financial activities of mainland companies in American markets, Hong Kong's role for launching IPOs could grow further, he notes.For now, it's Hong Kong's proximity to China, and its special status, that make it such an important location for businesses, analysts say.Strudwick said Beijing's efforts to build a \"Greater Bay area\" encompassing Hong Kong and other parts of the manufacturing-heavy Pearl River Delta are helping to integrate the territory more closely with neighbors such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen. That might help revitalize its economy, which expanded at an anemic 0.6% annual rate in the last quarter, battered by slowing demand and trade tensions.While unemployment is low, bread-and-butter issues such as how to afford to live in a city with the world's priciest real estate are adding to frustrations.Salaries come nowhere close to matching the territory's per capita GDP of nearly $50,000 a year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a reflection of the vast disparities in wealth between those living in villas on Victoria Peak and the majority occupying tiny apartments that sell for about $24,000 per square meter.\"Everything has changed. I am not talking about democracy, it seems no matter how hard you work, your life remains hard. In the past, you could afford an apartment if you worked hard,\" said a laundry shop worker who like many protest supporters gave only her first name, Lisa. \"This is a huge difference.\"For a country like China whose leaders often boast of a 3,000-plus year history, 50 years is only a snippet of time. For Hong Kong residents taking to the streets in protest, it's the better part of a lifetime.\"It's how the social strata and those freedoms are managed that is going to be the focus of future potential protest activity and unrest and uncertainty,\" Strudwick said. \"It's still going to be a major global city into the future. It's a case of understanding the risks and knowing what you're getting into come that 2047 time frame.\"", "Taiwan defends U.S. arms deal after China sanctions threat,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,13,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan on Saturday defended a proposal to purchase $2.2 billion in arms from the U.S., following a Chinese announcement that it would sanction any American companies involved in the deal.U.S. weapons help strengthen Taiwan's self-defense in the face of a growing military threat from China, the defense ministry said.\"The national army will continue to strengthen its key defense forces, ensure national security, protect its homeland and ensure that the fruits of freedom and democracy won't be attacked,\" the ministry said in a statement.China announced late Friday that it would impose sanctions on any U.S. enterprises involved in the deal, saying it \"undermines China's sovereignty and national security.\"Taiwan split from China during a civil war in 1949, but the mainland still considers the self-governing island as part of its territory.The U.S., which recognized Beijing as the government of China in 1979, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but U.S. law requires that it provide Taiwan with sufficient defense equipment and services for self-defense.The Trump administration announced the proposed $2.2 billion sale, which would include 108 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger surface-to-air missiles, earlier in the week.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, speaking in New York on Friday, said that her government has strengthened Taiwan's national defense to protect its democracy, according to a transcript posted on the presidential office website.China has objected to her U.S. visit, which Taiwan calls a \"two-evening transit stop\" on the way to Haiti and three other Caribbean nations that recognize Taiwan.\"We urge the U.S. to abide by the 'One China' principle and ... not allow Tsai Ing-wen's stopover, cease official exchanges with Taiwan and refrain from providing any platform for separatist Taiwan independence forces,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday in Beiijng.Tsai dismissed Chinese criticism of both her visit and the arms deal. \"We don't need our neighbor to make irresponsible remarks,\" she told reporters in New York, according to Taiwan's official Central News Agency.She has rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong.

Activists have vowed to keep up the pressure until she does so. Many are also demanding her resignation.The Chinese government's chief representative in Hong Kong said Thursday that the central government firmly supports Lam in continuing to govern. Wang Zhimin dismissed calls to exonerate protesters who have been arrested, saying it would be \"a blatant challenge to the rule of law in Hong Kong.\"\"Regarding the recent series of violent incidents, all Hong Kong people, including those present, have expressed condemnation,\" he said in a speech to Beijing loyalists in Hong Kong.Pro-democracy activists placed sunflowers and sang hymns at the memorial for Leung. He has been nicknamed the \"Raincoat Man\" for the yellow raincoat he was wearing when he died, just hours after Lam announced the indefinite suspension of the bills.The Rev. Yuen Tin-Yau said at the memorial that Leung wasn't a martyr but that he wanted justice. Yuen urged Hong Kong people to \"be courageous and be persistent\" in carrying out their peaceful struggle so that Leung didn't die in vain. Apart from Leung, three other young people have reportedly died, including a woman who left a suicide message.\"Mr. Leung's death brought us pain, but this is the way he has spoken out against the authorities. He has already finished what he should do. Today, Hong Kong people still need to speak up, and they need to speak up with an even louder and stronger voice,\" Yuen said.The protests against the proposed extradition legislation have given voice to fears that Hong Kong is losing the freedoms guaranteed to it when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. Critics fear suspects would face unfair and politicized trials in mainland China, and that critics of the ruling Communist Party would be targeted.Billy Li, a lawyer who stopped by the memorial after attending court, said he shared the frustration of the protesters.\"Even when you see the young people break into the legislative building to air their anger, to some extent I can understand their desperation. So I came here because I somehow feel the pathway of Mr. Leung. The responsibility of his death is somehow shared by every one of us, because we could not stop the bill earlier, before the death of Mr. Leung,\" Li said.On July 1, the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain back to China, a peaceful march drew hundreds of thousands of people but was overshadowed by an assault on the territory's legislative building.

In previous years, the area has been a battleground for Hong Kong people angry over the flood of Chinese day-trippers.Another protest on Sunday will take place in the suburban district of Sha Tin, which has also been the site of clashes between Hong Kong residents and mainland visitors.The protesters are expected to use similar tactics to those of a rally at a tourist area on Sunday, where they handed out pamphlets printed in the simplified Chinese characters used on the mainland. They also shouted slogans in Mandarin, China's most common dialect.\"They hope they can make an influence, which the Chinese government is obviously very afraid of,\" said a 22-year-old student from Hong Kong who runs an Instagram page called AntiELAB that aims to raise awareness about the protests and political situation in Hong Kong. Instagram is blocked in mainland China.\"It's evolving every day and that's how it should be,\" said the Britain-based student, referring to the movement where, he says, \"everyone is their own leader.\"Under the terms of the handover from Britain in 1997, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.But for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.The protesters' tactics have evolved significantly since the \"Umbrella\" movement demonstrations in late 2014, which paralyzed parts of the former British colony for 79 days but did not win concessions from Beijing on greater democracy.That failure, coupled with prosecutions of at least 100 protesters, mostly youths, had until last month discouraged many young people from going back to the streets.Activists are mobilizing supporters through a host of Internet forums and messaging app groups, taking out ads in international newspapers and petitioning diplomats to raise awareness among world leaders. All of it is meant to complicate Beijing's diplomatic agenda.Denise Ho, a Hong Kong singer and activist banned in mainland China, urged international action in an address on Monday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. Beijing's delegation twice interrupted her speech with points of order.\"I think this is really something that we haven't seen before. It is a new age of protest,\" said Labor Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung, who along with others is on a hunger strike over the extradition bill.\"The mainland population has to come to accept Hong Kong as having a different system. Without that understanding and consent, the conflict between the two populations would come about eventually and then the two systems cannot be protected.\"People rallied in cities across the world in June, including London, New York, Toronto and Melbourne, coinciding with demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled city that organizers said drew around a million people.The demonstrators are also erecting \"Lennon Walls\" across Hong Kong, including in rural and pro-Beijing districts, with supporters pasting colorful protest memos along pedestrian underpasses, footbridges, tunnels and near temples.One message on many walls reads: \"Fight Together.\"Many of the students were babies or toddlers when Britain returned Hong Kong to China. But they have adopted the colonial flag as a symbol of protest and even draped it over the speaker's lectern in the legislature when they stormed it hours after city leaders toasted the 22nd anniversary of the handover.China has condemned the protests in Hong Kong as an \"undisguised challenge\" to the formula under which the city is ruled, although some observers say the protesters still have some way to go before they cross Chinese leader Xi Jinping's \"red line\" of undermining Chinese sovereignty.\"As long as they don't strive for independence of Hong Kong with a large number of people, and push mainlanders to revolt against the Chinese Communist Party, I believe the red line is still quite far away,\" said Ming Sing, an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "Hong Kong protesters to continue after bill declared \u00e2\u0080\u0098dead\u00e2\u0080\u0099,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,10,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong protest leaders opposed to the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday that they will continue their demonstrations, even after Lam declared the effort to amend a highly contentious extradition bill \"dead.\"Protesters are persisting in their demands for the bill to be formally withdrawn and an investigation opened into heavy-handed tactics used by police against demonstrators.

She is playing word games,\" said Chan Wai Lam William, general officer of the Student Union of Chinese University of Hong Kong.Demonstrators have called for Lam to resign as Hong Kong chief executive, for an independent investigation into police actions against protesters, and for the government to abandon the description of a violent protest on June 12 as a riot.\"It is not a simple thing for CE (chief executive) to step down, and I myself still have the passion and undertaking to service Hong Kong people,\" Lam said when asked about the protesters' demands.\"I hope that Hong Kong society can give me and my team the opportunity and room to allow us to use our new governance style to response to people's demand in economy and in livelihood.\"Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy, but in recent years there has been growing concern about the erosion of those freedoms at the hands of Beijing.Critics of the extradition bill fear Beijing could use it to crack down on dissent.China has called the protests an \"undisguised challenge\" to the \"one country, two systems\" model under which Hong Kong is ruled that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who has been aligned with the protesters, said Lam's response was insufficient.\"She still doesn't get it.

Just like them, she seems to have gotten under Beijing's skin--this time at an international human rights venue.The Cantopop singer used her star power to stand up to China's economic and political power at the U.N.'s top human rights body Monday, telling the Human Rights Council that human rights were under attack in Hong Kong and asking whether it would suspend China as a member of the 47-nation body for its abuses.Ever sensitive to its growing international reputation, China shot back and interrupted Ho twice during her allotted 90-second slot. The chair, Iceland's ambassador in Geneva Harald Aspelund, gave some gentle reminders, but let her keep talking.Ho's comments were some of the sharpest and most varied criticism of China that the council has heard since the United States pulled out last year, partly over Trump administration complaints that too many rights-violating states were among its members. The United States had been generally seen as one of the countries least hesitant to stand up to its rising rival at the Geneva-based council.Ho ripped into the bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China for trial, saying such a move would \"remove the firewall protecting Hong Kong from interference of the Chinese government\"--an allusion to a British-China agreement linked to Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997.Chinese diplomat Dai Demao quickly upbraided her, saying she had wrongly referred to Hong Kong \"side-by-side\" with China. He said that was an affront to the widely recognized \"One China\" policy.Ho then denounced the disqualifications of lawmakers, the jailing of activists and the \"cross-border kidnappings\" of booksellers in Hong Kong as signs of \"China's tightening grip.\" She said Hong Kong autonomy had slowly eroded since the handover. She accused China of \"preventing our democracy at all costs\" such as by appointing as Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam, who the protesters want to see ousted.Dai burst in again to reject \"unfounded allegations\" and appealed to the chair that she refrain from using \"abusive language.\"Unbowed, Ho raised the tone again, asking the council whether it would suspend China and convene an urgent session to protect people in Hong Kong amid rising protests.UN Watch, the advocacy group that hosted Ho, faulted Western countries for not speaking out in her defense. China's envoy also blasted the nongovernmental organization, saying it had \"abused its consultative status\" and engaged in slandering--without mentioning the group or Ho by name.Speaking to reporters afterward, Ho said she hadn't received any threats for her outspokenness.\"I don't know if it will stay this way,\" she said. \"I will stand strong.\"In an interview with The Associated Press before the session, Ho said the implications of China's alleged rights abuses went far beyond Hong Kong, in places like Tibet and China's Xinjiang region, home to many Uighur Muslims.\"This is a very serious issue and a global issue, that not only touches Hong Kong people, but really the global world--where you see governments they are silencing themselves, because of being afraid of political reprisal, economic reprisal,\" she said.Ho praised a \"creative move\" by protesters in Kowloon over the weekend who reached out to incoming tourists from mainland China, saying many people in China had been \"brainwashed to think that Hong Kong people are just rioters and anti-China, which is not true.\"Ho said her activism has come at a price: She hasn't had any commercial work for the last several years, and she can't travel to China. But she brushed off the personal impact, and said she'll stay committed to the cause--even though she can't predict how things will evolve.\"The police they are still using excessive force,\" she said. \"As long as the Hong Kong government keeps on ignoring everything that's happening and just pretending that it's OK, these protests will go on--I'm quite sure of that.\"", "Tens of thousands in Hong Kong take message to mainlanders,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,8,2019": "HONG KONG--Tens of thousands of people, many wearing black shirts and some carrying British colonial-era flags, marched in Hong Kong on Sunday, targeting a mainland Chinese audience as a month-old protest movement showed no signs of abating.Chanting \"Free Hong Kong\" and words of encouragement to their fellow citizens, wave after wave of demonstrators streamed by a shopping district popular with mainland visitors on a march to the high-speed railway station that connects the semi-autonomous Chinese territory to Guangdong and other mainland cities.Hong Kong has been riven by huge marches and sometimes disruptive protests for the past month, sparked by proposed changes to extradition laws that would have allowed suspects to be sent to the mainland to face trial. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam suspended the bill and apologized for how it was handled, but protesters want it to be formally withdrawn and for Lam to resign.Organizers said 230,000 people marched on Sunday, while police estimated the crowd at 56,000.\"We want to show our peaceful, graceful protest to the mainland visitors because the information is rather blocked in mainland,\" march organizer Ventus Lau said. \"We want to show them the true image and the message of Hong Kongers.\"Chinese media have not covered the protests or their origins widely, focusing on clashes with police and damage to public property.As the crowd broke up Sunday night, a few hundred remained and taunted police who had retreated behind huge barriers set up outside the railway station, while others moved to Canton Road, a street lined with luxury boutique stores. Around 11 p.m., police moved to disperse protesters who were blocking a road and arrested five people for assaulting or obstructing police officers, their statement said.The march was the first major action since two simultaneous protests last Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the July 1, 1997, return of Hong Kong from Britain to China.The march through central Hong Kong that's held annually drew hundreds of thousands of people. It was overshadowed this year, however, by an assault on the legislative building by a few hundred demonstrators who shattered thick glass panels to enter the building and then wreaked havoc for three hours, spray-painting slogans on the chamber walls, overturning furniture and damaging electronic voting and fire prevention systems.Sunday's march was the first protest against the extradition legislation to take place on the Kowloon side of Hong Kongharbor. The previous ones were on Hong Kong Island, the city's business and government center.Many of the marchers were young and wore black shirts that have become the uniform of the protesters. The largely peaceful crowd also included older people carrying handheld fans in the muggy heat, as well as parents with children, including some in baby strollers.Many held placards, including one that read \"Extradite to China, disappear forever.\" Some carried the British flag or the old Hong Kong flag from when it was a British colony.\"This is our fourth march because we think this government is not taking care of Hong Kong,\" said Dan Lee, who joined with his wife and their three children. \"We need to save Hong Kong and we need to come out for our future generations.\"The extradition legislation has raised concerns about an erosion of freedoms and rights in Hong Kong, which was guaranteed its own legal system for 50 years after its return to China in 1997.Prior to the march, police put up large barricades blocking a main entrance to the railway station to prevent any attempt to enter it. Only passengers with train reservations were allowed into the station, the mass transit authority said, and Hong Kong media reported that ticket sales had been suspended for afternoon trains.\"The high-speed railway station is a connection between Hong Kong and China and this is the nearest place we can spread our message to China,\" said Lau, the march organizer.The station was a source of contention before it opened last September, because passengers pass through Chinese immigration and customs inside. Some opposition lawmakers said the fact that Chinese law applies in the immigration area violates the handover agreement under which Hong Kong maintains its own legal system.Protesters also are demanding an independent investigation into a crackdown on June 12 demonstrations in which officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds blocking major streets. Police said the tactics, harsher than usual for Hong Kong, were justified after some protesters turned violent. Dozens were injured, both protesters and police.The protesters are also calling for the direct election of Hong Kong's leader.

I think it you reject Huawei you will miss enormous opportunities. I think they are here for win-win cooperation they are not here to spy on people,\" he said.Hundreds of protesters in the former British colony besieged and broke into the legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of return to Chinese rule.Critics say the extradition bill would undermine Hong Kong's much-cherished independent judiciary and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party.Liu told the BBC that Hong Kong had received no instructions or orders from Beijing to introduce the bill.

Food and beverage outlets would also be closed.Online train tickets between Hong Kong and Shenzhen on the mainland were displayed as sold out from 2.30 p.m.-6.30 p.m., coinciding with the hours of the protest.Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK said more than 1,000 police officers would be on standby. Police said on Sunday some roads would be closed temporarily and public transport would be diverted.Hong Kong's Tourism Association has also said some travel agencies would stay away from the fashionable Tsim Sha Tsui area, popular with mainland visitors, on Sunday.Organizers have produced witty advertisements to urge people to join the march. \"Dear magicians, if you were unable to turn the cold-hearted into warm-hearted, take to the streets with us on July 7,\" said one.The extradition bill, which has left Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam clinging to her job, would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city.Lawyers and rights groups say China's justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention, claims that Beijing denies.

This followed mass demonstrations last month against Lam's extradition bill, which critics fear could see Hong Kong citizens sent for trial in the mainland.Lam, who is backed by Beijing, said she has paused efforts to push for the bill, but protesters are demanding a full withdrawal.In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Lam said late on Thursday Lam had \"recently started inviting young people of different backgrounds for a meeting, including university students and young people who have participated in recent protests.\"The student union at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), one of eight major higher education institutions, turned down the offer, saying Lam had requested a closed-door meeting.\"The dialogue must be open to all Hong Kong citizens to participate, and allow everybody the right to speak,\" the union said in a statement published on Facebook.Lam's spokeswoman said the chief executive hoped the HKUST student union would reconsider taking part in the meeting, which would be held in a \"small-scale and closed-door manner\" to facilitate an \"in-depth and frank exchange of views.\"A leader of the Hong Kong University Students' Union, Jordan Pang, said although he had not received an invitation to meet Lam, he would only agree to if the government promised not to investigate protesters involved in demonstrations between June 9 and July 1.\"We don't understand why she didn't openly respond to the people's demands but prefer to do it through a closed-door meeting,\" Pang said.\"We want to ask if the government sincerely wants to communicate with young people or if it's just another political PR show.\"Students have echoed opposition calls in recent weeks for the withdrawing of the extradition bill, for Lam to step down and for an investigation into complaints of police brutality against protesters.They have also called for Lam to stop labeling protesters \"rioters\" and to introduce genuine universal suffrage.Students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, another of the city's eight higher education institutions, were also invited to meet Lam but had not decided how to respond, a source at the student union there said.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.But many city residents reject what they see as increasing meddling by the mainland and the erosion of freedoms.Beijing denies interfering but nevertheless, many people in Hong Kong see the proposed extradition law as more tightening of the mainland's control over the financial hub.", "Britain denies supporting violent Hong Kong protests as China media slam 'Western ideologues',REUTERS,July,4,2019": "LONDON/BEIJING--British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday that he had not backed violent protests in Hong Kong, after Chinese state media blamed \"Western ideologues\" for fomenting unrest in the former British colony.Hundreds of protesters broke into the Hong Kong legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of the return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that includes freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest.That followed weeks of protests against a now-suspended extradition bill that opponents say would undermine Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party.China has stepped up a war of words with Britain over Hong Kong, especially after Hunt warned of consequences if China neglects commitments made when it took back Hong Kong to allow its way of life for at least 50 years.State media in particular has blamed London, Washington and other Western capitals for offering succor to the demonstrators.\"Ideologues in Western governments never cease in their efforts to engineer unrest against governments that are not to their liking, even though their actions have caused misery and chaos in country after country in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia,\" the official China Daily said in an editorial.\"Now they are trying the same trick in China,\" the English-language newspaper said.Hunt, speaking to BBC radio, reiterated his condemnation of the violence.\"Let me be clear what I said.

Britain says it still considers the Joint Declaration in 1984 on the terms of the return of Hong Kong, which guarantees its freedoms, to be valid.\"I don't think it's a big surprise that China would react that way but they need to understand that Britain is a country that honors its international obligations and what I was saying was something very uncontroversial, actually, which is that we signed an agreement in 1984 which lasts for 50 years and we would expect all sides to honor that agreement,\" Hunt said.\"Hong Kong has an independent judiciary and it's not for me as foreign secretary of the UK to second guess how that judiciary works.

His comments were met by a sharp rebuke from China's ambassador to the UK, who told Britain to keep its hands off Hong Kong.Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang did not offer any new criticism about Britain, having the day before accused Hunt of being \"shameless\" for his remarks on Hong Kong.\"For the time being today, I'll restrain myself and won't say anymore.

Hours later, protesters swarmed into the legislature, leaving a trail of destruction before riot police ordered them out three hours later.\"After the incident, I have strong reason to believe that the central government together with the Hong Kong government will try their very best to tighten their control in Hong Kong and try to undermine the 'one country, two systems' furthermore,\" Lam said Wednesday.Many people in Hong Kong worry that China is chipping away at the freedoms and rights they were guaranteed for 50 years after the then-British colony was returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework 22 years ago this week.As hundreds of thousands of people marched on Monday to voice these fears, a much smaller group of young protesters decided to break into the legislature, which was closed for a national holiday marking the anniversary of Hong Kong's July 1, 1997, handover to China.They started with a thick glass wall, hammering it over and over with a large cart.\"Please listen to me, it's very dangerous,\" Lam screamed at them, warning that they could face long prison sentences for their actions. Another lawmaker who stood between the cart and window was tackled by a protester, and later appeared dazed and slightly injured.Lam said that the young protesters, who have blocked streets, police headquarters and other government buildings in a series of protests over the past three weeks, have sacrificed enough.\"It's time for us to try our very best to convince them not to sacrifice anymore, but some of them even told us they are well prepared to die for Hong Kong,\" he said, recounting Monday's events at the site. \"It's very sad. It's very sad.\"Hong Kong police have blocked off the legislative building as a crime scene. Protesters sprayed slogans in the main chamber, tore down and bashed portraits of legislative leaders and tipped over file cabinets in offices, strewing papers on the floors. At least one elevator was heavily damaged, as were a metal curtain-wall that was forcefully pried open and glass walls that were shattered on two sides of the building.A Chinese government spokesman said that \"violent lawbreakers\" had intentionally damaged Hong Kong government facilities, calling them \"serious illegal acts that trample on the rule of law and endanger social order.\"The demonstrators had grown increasingly frustrated that, despite repeated disruptive protests, the government had not given them a response to their demands. They include the formal withdrawal of a suspended extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to China for trial, the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, the release of those arrested after a June 12 protest and an independent investigation into the unusually harsh police response on that day, which included tear gas and rubber bullets.The government says the suspension of the bill effectively killed it. Carrie Lam, who was criticized for disappearing from public view for two weeks, said Tuesday that releasing suspects without investigation would violate Hong Kong's rule of law.Lam, the pro-democracy lawmaker, said the protesters felt hopeless and powerless and wanted to make noise to show the government and the outside world that they would not give up: \"That was their choice, even if I don't agree with them, even if they understand the tactic may not work, they still wanted to try to show their anger and frustration to the government and the international community.\"", "Flag-waving Grandma Wong gives lesson in endurance,REUTERS,July,3,2019": "HONG KONG--Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have clogged the streets of Hong Kong in recent weeks, silver-haired, bespectacled \"Grandma Wong,\" usually seen waving a large British flag, stands out.Alexandra Wong, 63, who has smaller Union Jack flags pinned to her clothes and bags, has been on the front lines of mass protests in the former British colony and sometimes in tense standoffs between police and student activists.\"I bought them in Shenzhen,\" a smiling Wong, known affectionately as grandma, told Reuters of the flags, referring to the southern Chinese city across the border where she now lives.\"I had to ask secretly, because they only showed the Chinese flag. So I asked them if they had the British flag and they take it out to show me.

Its coverage of the protests and the publication of a harsh editorial in the official Communist Party newspaper Global Times may indicate it is prepared to take a tougher line against the demonstrators following days of forbearance.\"These violent assailants in their arrogance pay no heed to Hong Kong's law, no doubt arousing the anger and sadness of all people of the city of Hong Kong,\" the editorial said.Television images showed police moving into roads surrounding the legislative council, where protesters smashed through glass and metal barriers to occupy the space for about three hours on Monday night until police moved in shortly after midnight.Veteran opposition figure Joshua Wong acknowledged that the damage to the legislative offices has drawn criticism from some sectors in the Asian financial hub. But he said mass participation in marches and rallies over previous weeks showed there was a groundswell of support for the demonstrators' goals of demanding more accountability from the administration of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\"I understand people in Hong Kong and around the world might not 100 percent agree or disagree on all of the behavior of protesters ... but all of the requests have been ignored. So, is there any way out?\" Wong said.Lam is \"not capable as leader anymore\" and should resign, Wong said, echoing the demand of many protesters. Having been elected by a Beijing-approved committee, Lam is reliant on continuing support from Beijing, which has shown no outward signs of abandoning her so far.Wong also accused police officers of having \"double standards\" in enforcing the law, saying pro-Beijing legislators and their staff members have benefited by better treatment than their opposition counterparts throughout the weeks of protest outside the legislature.On the mainland, Beijing had sought to suppress news of the protests, which roughly coincided with celebrations of the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule. The demonstrations reflect mounting frustration with Lam and her government for not responding to demands from opposition figures that were originally sparked by a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China for trial. Lam has shelved the bills but not agreed to scrap them altogether as opponents insist she does.Hundreds of protesters swarmed into Hong Kong's legislature Monday night, defacing portraits of lawmakers and spray-painting pro-democracy slogans in the chamber before vacating it as riot police cleared surrounding streets with tear gas and then moved inside.Protesters whacked away at thick glass windows until they shattered and then pried open steel security gates. Police initially retreated as the protesters entered, avoiding a confrontation and giving them the run of the building, during which they spray painted slogans calling for a democratic election of Hong Kong's leader and denouncing the extradition legislation. Many wore yellow and white helmets, face masks and the black T-shirts that have become their uniform.The actions prompted organizers of a separate peaceful march against the extradition bill to change the endpoint of their protest from the legislature to a nearby park, after police asked them to call it off or change the route. Police wanted the march to end earlier in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district, but organizers said that would leave out many people who planned to join the march along the way.Police estimated that 190,000 people joined the peaceful march, the third major one in as many weeks. Organizers put the turnout at 550,000.The extradition proposal has heightened fears of eroding freedoms in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to China on July 1, 1997. Debate on the measure has been suspended indefinitely. Protesters want the bills formally withdrawn and Lam to resign.Lam, who has come under withering criticism for trying to push the legislation through, called a rare pre-dawn news conference with security officials Tuesday at police headquarters. She noted that two different protests happened Monday--one a generally orderly march that reflected Hong Kong's inclusiveness, the other using vandalism and violence.\"This is something we should seriously condemn,\" she said.Lam disputed protesters' complaints that officials had not responded to them, saying the government explained that by suspending the bill with no timetable or plan to revisit it, the legislation would die at the end of the current legislative session in July 2020.For the other demands, she said releasing arrested protesters without an investigation would not uphold the rule of law.The extradition bill controversy has given fresh momentum to Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition movement, awakening broader concerns that China is chipping away at the rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years under the \"one country, two systems\" framework. The two marches in June drew more than a million people, according to organizer estimates.Surveying damage to the building on Tuesday morning, Legislative Council President Andrew Leung said the previous night's violence had undermined \"the core values of Hong Kong.\" He said police were collecting evidence of criminal wrongdoing.\"I believe many Hong Kong people will share the same feeling with me that we are saddened by what happened last night.

The crowd has started filing out of Victoria Park but police asked the marchers to change their route or cancel the march.Both the combative protesters and the marchers oppose a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China to face trial.

She later told reporters she was voicing the grievances and opinions of the protesters, who could not get into the event.The annual march starting in the afternoon was expected to be larger than usual because the proposed extradition bill has awakened broader fears that China is eroding the freedoms and rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years under a \"one country, two systems\" framework. Two marches in June against the legislation drew more than a million people, according to organizer estimates.The government has suspended debate on the bill indefinitely, but protest leaders want it formally withdrawn and Lam's resignation. They also are demanding an independent inquiry into police actions during a June 12 protest, when officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who blocked the legislature on the day debate on the bill had been scheduled to resume.The police say the use of force was justified, but have largely since adopted softer tactics, even as protesters besieged police headquarters in recent days, pelting it with eggs and spray-painting slogans on its outer walls.The area around Golden Bauhinia Square, where the flag-raising ceremony took place, was blocked off from Saturday to prevent protesters from gathering to disrupt it. Before the morning ceremony, protesters trying to gain access to the square were driven back by officers with plastic shields and batons, the retreating protesters pointing open umbrellas to ward off pepper spray.\"We are horrified, this is our obligation to do this, we are protecting our home,\" said Jack, a 26-year-old office worker who would only give his first name. \"I don't know why the government is harming us. It's harming the rule of law, the rule of law is the last firewall between us and the Chinese Communist Party.\"", "Hong Kong braces for protests amid annual handover rally,REUTERS,July,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of protesters faced off with riot police early on Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, ahead of an annual rally that is expected to draw huge crowds amid widespread anger over a controversial extradition bill.More than a million people have taken to the streets at times over the past three weeks to vent their anger and frustration at Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam, posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Opponents of the now-suspended extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, fear it is a threat to Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law and are demanding it be scrapped and Lam step down.Police fired pepper spray to disperse some demonstrators, mostly black-clad students wearing hard hats and face masks, ahead of a flag-raising ceremony to mark the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule.Riot police with helmets and batons raced towards protesters at one point and held up red banners warning they would use force if the activists charged.A tired-looking Lam appeared in public for the first time in nearly two weeks to attend the anniversary ceremony, flanked by her husband and former Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa. Authorities deployed a huge security blanket around the venue.Lam said the government needed to change its style of governance to be more accommodating and open and pledged to do more for young people.\"The incident that happened in recent months has led to controversies and disputes between the public and the government. This has made me fully realize that I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,\" Lam said.\"After this incident, I will learn the lesson and ensure that the government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community,\" she said.The anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to Beijing in 1997 has been marked in recent years by deepening despondency about what many Hong Kong residents see as a relentless march towards mainland control.Tensions spiraled on June 12 when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at anti-extradition protesters near the heart of the financial center, sending plumes of smoke billowing among some of the world's tallest skyscrapers.Lam's suspension of the bill, following the largest and most violent protests in decades, has done little to pacify opponents who are demanding it be scrapped altogether.The extradition law has hit a nerve across Hong Kong, drawing criticism from business people, legal circles, schools and church groups, and has plunged the Asian financial center into political turmoil.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.Beijing denies interfering. The uproar over the bill has reignited a protest movement that had lost steam after pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 failed to force concessions from Beijing and led to the arrests of hundreds of activists.Organizers of the recent protests say they are confident that anger over the government's failure to withdraw the extradition bill will boost numbers at the annual rally on Monday, a public holiday on which financial markets and most businesses will be closed.The pro-democracy rally is due to start at 0630 GMT in Victoria Park on Hong Kong island and end at government offices near the heart of the financial center.The recent demonstrations have brought havoc, forcing the closure of government offices on several occasions and triggering chaos as protesters blocked roads and besieged police headquarters.The South China Morning Post cited unidentified sources as saying about 5,000 riot police would be ready for any trouble.The turmoil comes at a delicate time for Beijing, which is grappling with a trade dispute with the United States, a faltering economy and tensions in the South China Sea.Lam said after suspending the bill she had heard the people \"loud and clear.\" However, she stopped short of activists' demands to scrap the bill altogether and rejected calls to step down.She is clinging to her job despite an unprecedented backlash against the government that has galvanized people from all walks of life to take to the streets in protest.Activists are also demanding the government drop charges against those arrested during the protests, charge police with what they describe as excessive use of force and stop referring to the demonstrations as a riot, a term that can bring a heavier jail sentence.Opponents of the extradition bill fear it would put them at the mercy of China's justice system, where human rights are not guaranteed.Beyond the public outcry, the extradition bill has spooked some of Hong Kong's tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details.", "In Taiwan, Hong Kong immigrants despair over future back home,REUTERS,June,30,2019": "TAINAN, Taiwan--Kitty Wong and Adolf Lim are tightening the screws on their future in Taiwan as they make the final touches to a hostel in the southern city of Tainan, that they hope will open its doors to holiday-makers next month.The couple from Hong Kong came to Taiwan in search of a stress-free life after being disappointed with the fragmentation of society back in Hong Kong, along with the daily negativity that they found hard to escape. This is the third hostel they are opening after arriving in 2016.\"The level of evil that you are dealing with is too high, I just see no way out,\" Yim says, talking about how the Chinese Communist Party is clamping down on freedom in his home town.It is not only the pressure from the mainland that made him pack his bags, but also daily acts of frustration that drive a wedge in society.\"As they are unable to attack Uncle Xi, they go ahead and attack tourists,\" he said, referring to the attitude of fellow Hong Kong citizens to visitors from the mainland, who are often resented for their perceived poor manners.\"I feel incapable to change the regime, but I am also unable to accept this sort of behavior.\"\"Recently, we've been getting a lot of inquiries,\" says Kitty Wong, referring to their status as something of a point of contact for Hong Kong citizens wanting to make the jump.Many of the Hong Kong people ask about the possibility of gaining citizenship in Taiwan as investors.The number of people granted Taiwan residency from Hong Kong and neighboring Macau, a former Portuguese enclave also given special autonomy under Chinese rule, has more than doubled to 1,267 in 2018 from a decade ago, official data shows.The trend spiked in the two years following big protests calling for full democracy in 2014 that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for months. And it shows no signs of abating.There were about 400 such immigrants to Taiwan in the first four months of 2019, a 40-percent jump from a year ago.Cafe owner Ricky Chang first came to Taiwan as a student and decided to settle down in Tainan in 2013 after several stints in other countries. He too is an often approached for advice by hopeful immigrants who are eager to gain citizenship in Taiwan in case things get too difficult in Hong Kong.Although he didn't move to Taiwan for political reasons, a proposed extradition law in Hong Kong has changed his thinking.\"I'm worried that I have been engaging in some behaviors that, although they are legal in Taiwan and don't go against the law, might be seen as violations of the law in mainland China and that there might come a day when I travel on a plane with a layover in Hong Kong or go back to Hong Kong to see my parents, that I might be arrested at the airport,\" he said.The extradition bill is the latest in a string of issues that have troubled ties between Hong Kong and Beijing, and sparked big protests in the financial hub.Hong Kong people have in recent years been increasingly upset by mainland immigrants and sky-high property prices partly pushed up by mainland investors.The influx of mainlanders into Hong Kong was the main reason that drove Joe Ching, an entrepreneur in the logistics sector who still has operations in Hong Kong, across the Taiwan Strait to find a future for his family of three.\"I moved to Taiwan to look for another way forward because I don't want my children to have any interaction or link with mainland Chinese,\" he says.He said Taiwan people should think carefully about who they vote into office as the stakes are increasingly high.China has proposed using the \"one country, two systems\" formula, under which Hong Kong returned from British rule in 1997, for Taiwan, in case of a \"reunification\" of the self-ruled island and China.Taiwan is claimed by China as part of its territory, though the Communist-run government in Beijing has never ruled Taiwan.", "From Okinawa to Hong Kong to snap images of people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power,By SHOHEI OKADA/ Staff Writer,June,29,2019": "NAHA--Asahi Fukuhara snaps pictures for a living and felt he could not ignore the huge demonstrations being staged in Hong Kong over a proposed extradition measure.So, the 24-year-old went over to the former British colony to capture images of the outpouring of anger.Fukuhara, an Okinawa native, felt a special closeness to the activists not only because they are young like himself, but also because he himself had been deeply involved in a petition drive that led to a prefectural referendum earlier this year on a contentious plan by the central government to build a new base for the U.S. military in the southernmost prefecture.The referendum resulted in more than 70 percent of people in Okinawa casting ballots opposed to the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from Ginowan to the Henoko district of Nago.Fukuhara joined the movement to promote dialogue between proponents and opponents of the relocation.Fukuhara had been following events in Hong Kong through Twitter and saw that many of his age and even younger were joining in the protests against the extradition measure that would have sent criminal suspects in Hong Kong for court proceedings in the Chinese mainland.When he saw police firing tear gas into a crowd, he felt he had to do something other than just observe events from Okinawa.He talked about what was happening in Hong Kong with friends over drinks on June 14 and booked a flight to Hong Kong the following day.With close to 2 million protesters taking to the streets of Hong Kong, Fukuhara said: \"It felt like the ground was shaking. Their loud shouts against the measure resonated with my heart.\"He began snapping away at the crowd passing before him.A particularly large rally was held on June 16. Many of the participants were young people, with some couples also marching. Fukuhara continued to follow the protests until June 23.He took about 6,000 photos in total. He also shot video footage that he posted to Twitter and that was replayed about 20,000 times.What he saw in Hong Kong reminded Fukuhara in many ways of what is also happening in Okinawa.\"I thought they were very much like us,\" he said. \"The public will was on the verge of being crushed by the huge authority that is the state.\"Despite the overwhelming opposition in Okinawa to the Futenma relocation, land reclamation work continues unabated off the coast of Henoko waters.One sign Fukuhara saw in Hong Kong calling on the authorities to listen to the voice of the people gave him a hint of what was needed in Okinawa.He felt the decision to postpone implementation of the extradition measure was due in large part to the international attention attracted by the outpouring of anger in Hong Kong.That led him to conclude that the only way to change the status quo in Okinawa is to \"continue with our appeals to the world without abandoning hope.\"", "G-20 leaders facing calls to protect growth, open trade,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,28,2019": "OSAKA--World leaders attending a Group of 20 summit in Japan that began Friday are clashing over the values that have served for decades as the foundation of their cooperation as they face calls to fend off threats to economic growth.\"A free and open economy is the basis for peace and prosperity,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told his counterparts in opening the two-day G-20 meeting that comes as leaders grapple with profound tensions over trade, globalization and the collapsing nuclear deal with Iran.While groups like the G-20 endeavor to forge consensus on broad policy approaches and geopolitical issues, the rifts between them run both shallow and deep.Defying Chinese warnings not to bring up the issue of recent protests in Hong Kong, Abe cautioned Chinese President Xi Jinping over Beijing's human rights record.In a meeting late Thursday, Abe told Xi it is important for \"a free and open Hong Kong to prosper under 'one country, two systems' policy,\" Japanese officials said, referring to the arrangement for the former British colony's autonomy when China took control in 1997.They said Abe reminded Xi of the importance of guaranteeing freedom, human rights, the \"rule of law\" and other universal values in raising concern over proposed Hong Kong legislation that would allow some criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in mainland China. The bill, now shelved, drew hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents into the streets in protests.Xi is not the only leader facing a pushback from his Western counterparts.European Union Council President Donald Tusk blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for saying in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper that liberalism was \"obsolete\" and conflicts with the \"overwhelming majority\" in many countries.\"We are here as Europeans also to firmly and unequivocally defend and promote liberal democracy,\" Tusk told reporters. \"What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\"Tusk told reporters that such comments suggest a belief that \"freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete.\"Putin praised U.S. President Donald Trump for his efforts to try to stop the flow of migrants and drugs from Mexico and said that liberalism \"presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected.\"Trump has at times found himself at odds with other leaders in such international events, particularly on issues such as Iran, climate change and trade.A planned meeting between Trump and the Chinese president on Saturday as the G-20 meetings conclude has raised hopes for a detente in the tariffs war between the world's two largest economies.The two sides have levied billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on each other's imports in a festering dispute over technology and the chronic Chinese trade surplus.In a meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Trump said he had not promised to hold back on imposing new tariffs on China.\"I think it'll be productive,\" Trump said of his meeting with Xi. \"We'll see what happens tomorrow. It'll be a very exciting day I'm sure,\" he said. \"It's going to come out hopefully well for both countries.\"U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross accompanied Trump to Osaka, suggesting potential for some movement after 11 rounds of talks stalled in May.But while prospects for detente in the trade war are in the spotlight, many participating prefer a broader approach to tackling global crises.\"I am deeply concerned over the current global economic situation. The world is paying attention to the direction we, the G-20 leaders, are moving toward,\" Abe said. \"We need to send strong message, which is to support and strengthen a free, fair and indiscriminatory trade system.\"A breakthrough is not assured. On Thursday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing reiterated that China is determined to defend itself against further U.S. moves to penalize it over trade friction. China often has sought to gain support for defending global trade agreements against Trump's \"America First\" stance in gatherings like the G-20.Abe has sought to make the Osaka summit a landmark for progress on environmental issues, including climate change, on cooperation in developing new rules for the \"digital economy,\" such as devising fair ways to tax companies like Google and Facebook, and on strengthening precautions against abuse of technologies such as cyber-currencies to fund terrorism and other types of Internet-related crimes.On the rising tensions between Iran and the United States, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world can't afford the conflict and it was \"essential to de-escalate the situation\" and avoid confrontation. Iran is soon poised to surpass a key uranium stockpile threshold, threatening the nuclear accord it reached with world powers in 2015.Iran's moves come after Trump announced in May 2018 that he was pulling the United States out of the deal and reimposing economic sanctions on Tehran.In a letter to the leaders in Osaka, Guterres urged them to take action on equitable and stable reforms to strengthen the global financial safety net and increase the global economy's resilience.While there are good plans and vision, what's needed are \"accelerated actions, not more deliberations,\" he said.Fast and equal economic growth should be constructed so that people who live in \"the 'rust belts' of the world are not left behind,\" he said.The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, in a meeting on the G-20 sidelines, called for joint efforts to stabilize international trade and oppose protectionism.Putin, whose country faces an array of U.S. and EU sanctions, said at the meeting that \"international trade has suffered from protectionism, politically motivated restrictions and barriers.\" Putin also emphasized the need for BRICS nations to take coordinated action to help block sources of funding for terrorist groups.", "Abe, Xi stress closer ties while casting wary eye on Trump at G-20,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,June,28,2019": "OSAKA--Prime Minister Shinzo Abe played up Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improved relations with China on June 27, apparently in hopes of setting the tone for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.Abe and Xi met here before the formal start of the Group of 20 summit on June 28, and the prime minister wanted to capitalize on the fact that it was Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first visit to Japan as Chinese president.During their meeting, Abe told Xi he wanted to welcome him \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor a state visit in spring next year when the cherry blossoms are blooming.\u00e2\u0080\u009dXi responded that the proposal was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood idea.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough their meeting was held on the sidelines of the G-20 summit, Abe emphasized the importance of Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit by then hosting a dinner reception for the Chinese president.Behind the apparent blossoming friendship between Abe and Xi was a meeting scheduled for June 29 between the Chinese leader and the unpredictable and often confrontational president of the United States.With the United States and China now engaged in a bitter trade war, Abe, as host of the G-20 summit, does not want to see a blowup between Xi and Trump during their talks.Such a confrontation could have a major negative effect on the results of the summit and leave mud on Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as the Upper House election looms next month.Xi told Abe in their meeting that it would be important for any declaration emerging from the G-20 summit to contain wording about \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotecting multilateralism and free trade.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat was apparently meant to show China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for the summit host to bring together a declaration that can be agreed upon by all the leaders, including Trump.At the start of his meeting with Xi, Abe said bilateral relations with China had completely returned to a more normal course, adding that he wanted to create a new age for Japan-China ties by working closely with Xi.Xi responded that relations between the two nations stood at \u00e2\u0080\u009ca new and historic starting line.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter the meeting, Yasutoshi Nishimura, a deputy chief Cabinet secretary, briefed reporters and touched upon the \u00e2\u0080\u009ceternal neighbors\u00e2\u0080\u009d term used by Abe to describe the bilateral relationship.Nishimura said the two nations had to engage in constant and close communications because of their geographical relations. He added that despite the many issues between the two countries, the relationship could be managed and improved by building trust through mutual visits by the two leaders.During their hourlong meeting, Xi explained about his recent visit to Pyongyang for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Xi told Abe that he passed on to Kim the prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readiness to unconditionally hold talks with the North Korean leader.Abe also requested restraint from Beijing concerning Chinese ships entering Japanese territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea.In apparent reference to the huge protests in Hong Kong over proposed legislation to extradite criminal suspects to China for court proceedings, Abe said it was important to guarantee universal values, such as respect for human rights and rule of law.Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reference to the territorial dispute over the Senkakus highlights the reality behind China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more friendly approach at the top leader level.China still refers to the Diaoyu Islands as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccore interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d from which it cannot be seen to be backing away.Intrusions by Chinese government-related vessels into Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territorial waters around the Senkakus have occurred at a pace of three or four times a month, and the total number this year has already reached the same level for all of 2018.Chinese ships have also been spotted in the contiguous zone just outside territorial waters for a record 64 straight days.\"It is clear China is trying to back up its territorial claim by giving the impression that its ships are constantly in those waters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Japanese government source said.No progress has been made in talks about joint development of oil fields in the East China Sea.

Nearly 300 flights were already cancelled since its cabin crew went on strike on June 20, including flights from Taipei to Chicago, Paris, Seoul and Hong Kong.The week-long strike, which is the longest in Taiwan's aviation industry where labor unrest is uncommon, has led Eva to estimate a revenue loss of about T$1.34 billion ($43.16 million or 4.7 billion yen).The union representing Eva Air's flight attendants made several concessions on Thursday on its demands to improve work conditions and pay, having failed to reach an agreement with the airline's management after a months-long negotiation.\"The union has adjusted our proposal and is urging Eva Air to restart the negotiation as soon as possible,\" it said in a statement. \"We have been hoping that Eva Airways would restart negotiations swiftly to resolve the dispute.\"Eva Air said it was still working on a statement when contacted by Reuters.

Teresa Cheng, come out,\" the protesters chanted, referring to the justice secretary, interspersed with another demand, \"Condemn excessive force by police and release protesters.\"Early on Thursday, riot police wielding batons and shields chased dozens of protesters who had besieged police headquarters through the streets of Wan Chai, a popular nightspot.The government said while it respected the public's right to peaceful assembly it was unacceptable for protesters to block roads and surround police headquarters.The demonstrators have seized on this week's Group of 20 summit of world leaders in Japan to appeal for Hong Kong's plight to be put on the agenda, a move certain to rile Beijing, which has vowed not to tolerate such discussion.\"We know that the G-20 is coming. We want to grasp this opportunity to voice for ourselves,\" said Jack Cool Tsang, 30, a theater technician who took a day off work to protest.The protesters are also demanding the government release those arrested and investigate what they describe as excessive use of force by police officers.Images of police firing rubber bullets and tear gas beneath gleaming skyscrapers this month near the heart of the financial center grabbed global headlines and drew condemnation from international rights groups and protest organizers.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has kept a low profile over the past few days, suspended the bill a day after the violent protests but stopped short of a full withdrawal and rejected repeated calls to step down.The demonstrations, which pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012, have repeatedly forced the temporary closure of government offices, blocked major roads and caused massive disruptions.Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it has been governed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows it freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the liberty to protest and an independent judiciary.But many accuse China of increased meddling over the years, by obstructing democratic reform, interfering with elections, suppressing young activists, as well as being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.Opponents of the extradition bill fear being placed at the mercy of a justice system rights group say is plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions.", "Protesters urging G-20 to discuss Hong Kong issues,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,26,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activists opposed to contentious extradition legislation on Wednesday called on leaders of the United States, the European Union and others to raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping at this week's Group of 20 summit in Japan.Beijing has strongly opposed such a development, saying Hong Kong matters are strictly an internal Chinese affair.Groups of protesters gathered outside the U.S. and EU consulates Wednesday morning to deliver petitions stating their requests.A spokesman said changes to the Chinese territory's legislation could expose citizens of all nationalities to being extradited to China for unfair trials and possible torture, reducing Hong Kong's judicial independence and the civil liberties it retained after the handover from British rule in 1997.Activists planned to present petitions at 19 consulates in total and planned further protest actions for Wednesday evening following an expected vote of no-confidence in the local legislature on the administration of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Government supporters have a solid majority in the assembly and the measure is not expected to pass.Lam's push to pass the extradition bills has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to fill Hong Kong's streets in protest marches, while smaller groups have surrounded government offices, the legislature and police headquarters. They are demanding the total withdrawal of the legislation and accountability for heavy-handed police treatment of protesters at a protest earlier this month during which tear gas and rubber bullets were fired.Lam has shelved the legislation and apologized for not better handling the matter but has declined to respond to other demands.Several foreign governments, along with legal, commercial, human rights and media groups in Hong Kong, have expressed concern about the legislation as well as the Hong Kong government's handling of the protests.In a statement Tuesday in the House of Commons, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he raised the issue with Lam on June 12.Britain urges Hong Kong to establish a \"robust, independent investigation\" into the violence against protesters, and will not issue further export licenses for crowd control equipment to Hong Kong \"unless we are satisfied that concerns raised on human rights and fundamental freedoms have been thoroughly addressed,\" Hunt said.China says it fully backs Lam's administration's and has rejected foreign commentary over the protests and the extradition issue as interference in its internal affairs.At a briefing in Beijing on Monday, Zhang Jun, an assistant foreign minister, said, \"I can tell you that for sure the G-20 will not discuss the issue of Hong Kong and we will not allow the G-20 to discuss the issue of Hong Kong.\"Hong Kong's government \"has taken a series of measures to safeguard fairness and justice of society and to block loopholes in the legal system.

Twenty-two years on, those are rights many here believe Hong Kong cannot live without.The hundreds of thousands who marched in a June 16 protest over a now-shelved extradition bill, and those still demonstrating, are raising alarm that Hong Kong may become just another Chinese city as those protections unravel and Beijing's influence in the territory expands.Activists are planning more protests for Wednesday, hoping to win attention and support from world leaders gathering in Osaka, Japan, for the Group of 20 summit later this week.\"This is not about a power struggle,\" said Bonnie Leung, a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, one of a number of groups involved in organizing protests. \"This is about the values that make the world a better place.\"\"The whole world, whoever has connections with Hong Kong, would be stakeholders,\" she said.All of those involved--the territory's top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the police, lawmakers, the protesters and the rest of Hong Kong--are caught up in tensions stemming from the \"one country, two systems\" colonial legacy that bequeathed a Western-style civic society under a political system controlled by Beijing.The protests erupted after Beijing-backed Lam tried to push through legislation that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to face trial in Communist Party-dominated courts in mainland China. Many in Hong Kong viewed the bill as another step toward curbing protections they expect from their legal system.While they come from all walks of life, the protesters share a determination to preserve those freedoms, said Samson Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.\"This protest has drawn everybody in town together,\" he said. \"They really value the freedom to speak up and protest.\"Jerome A. Cohen, a leading expert on Chinese law and government, said the extradition bill would have deprived local authorities of the right to prevent forcible transfers by China of suspects, including visitors, \"for detention, trial and punishment that violate international standards of justice.\"The bill also would have enabled China to require Hong Kong authorities to freeze and confiscate assets of alleged suspects, Cohen wrote in a recent blog post. Efforts to limit the cases subject to extradition would not prevent suspects from being subject to China's \"incommunicado torture chambers, its denial of competent legal defenders and its unfair trials.\"Most Hong Kong residents belong to families that fled poverty and political upheavals in the communist mainland. British rule did not bequeath them democracy, but it laid the foundations for strong civic institutions, schools, health care--as well as a laissez faire trading regime dominated by business leaders deeply invested in keeping Hong Kong as it is.Normally reluctant to wade into political matters or criticize Beijing, businesses also expressed concern over the extradition bill, with the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce noting that the protests reflected \"serious apprehensions.\" The chamber welcomed the government's decision to suspend the bill, as did its American and British counterparts.It's unclear if the turnout for another big protest planned for the July 1 anniversary of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to Chinese control might match the earlier ones.Lam's push for the now stalled legislation, ill-timed around the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, and the tear gas, steel batons and other aggressive tactics used by police, especially in June 12 protests that turned violent, helped draw people young and old into the streets.Activists want an investigation into the complaints over police violence, along with Lam's resignation and other demands. But the continued protests reflect a deeper sense of grievance and unease, especially among Hong Kong residents coming of age in an era of declining economic opportunity, said Ken Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings.\"Social mobility is more and more theoretical in Hong Kong, so young people continue to be very dissatisfied. There's a broader concern about China in Hong Kong. The economy's not growing like people thought it would grow,\" Courtis said.In many respects, Hong Kong faces the same sorts of challenges of other developed economies with aging populations and slowing growth.The city of 7 million has an economy that is bigger than Vietnam's and a per capita GDP of more than $46,000 (5 million yen). But controls on land use favor property developers, and half the apartments available rent for $2,550 a month or more, while median monthly incomes are about $2,300.In a city dominated by business leaders and other elites, the only leverage protesters can wield is \"the power of numbers,\" said Yuen, noting that surveys of those participating in protests in recent weeks generally identify with the city's \"grassroots or lower classes.\"\"They see themselves as lower class because of crony capitalism in Hong Kong. It's very hard for them to get a fine paying job and also to buy an apartment in Hong Kong,\" he said.Brian Chow, one of the protesters sitting in the sweltering heat on a recent day outside the city's Legislative Council building, said he wasn't the \"type\" to get involved in violence.\"I'll just carry on sitting here, sing some Christian hymns, show our resistance, keep the government paralyzed until it responds to us,\" he said.After protesters blocked lines in the tax and immigration offices downtown on Monday, the government issued a statement appealing to them to \"act peacefully and rationally when expressing their opinions and not to affect those in need of government services.\"In her apologies over the extradition bill fiasco, Lam appealed for \"another chance\" and said she would focus on improving the economy and resolving the housing crisis.Chinese officials warned against \"outside interference\" but made a point of backing Lam's decision to sideline the proposal. At a time of severe trade friction with the United States, Beijing's higher priority lies in preserving Hong Kong's status as a financial hub and free port, Courtis said.\"People in Beijing are pragmatic. They see time in terms of many years,\" he said. \"Step sideways here, if that's not enough then step backwards. Now you focus on making the economy work and keeping people happy.\"", "Protesters block Hong Kong building access, plan new action,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,24,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters fearing an erosion of Hong Kong's legal autonomy blocked access to a government office building for nearly two hours Monday and plan more demonstrations to draw the attention of leaders attending the Group of 20 summit this week.About 100 demonstrators jammed the entryway and lobby of the Inland Revenue Tower, a skyscraper in the Wan Chai district in the city center.Earlier, one of the main protest groups announced a demonstration planned on Wednesday to try to draw the attention of world leaders attending the G-20 summit in Japan.The leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front said they hope the world leaders meeting in Osaka will hear the protesters' concerns over the weakening of the city's legal autonomy by mainland China.Hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets and sidewalks in recent weeks to oppose legislation seen as increasing Beijing's control and police treatment of the protesters. The activists spoke on Monday near the city government headquarters, where a few protesters remained though the offices in the building had reopened.Kelvin Ho, one of the group's several leaders, said the protest was meant to \"urge the international community to give stress on Beijing that we need democracy.\"China has rejected foreign commentary over the protests and the extradition issue as interference in its internal affairs.At a briefing in Beijing, Zhang Jun, an assistant foreign minister, said \"I can tell you that for sure the G-20 will not discuss the issue of Hong Kong and we will not allow the G-20 to discuss the issue of Hong Kong.\"Hong Kong's government \"has taken a series of measures to safeguard fairness and justice of society and to block loopholes in the legal system. We believe what they have done is completely necessary and the central government supports these measures,\" he said.Joshua Wong, another activist who helped galvanize mass pro-democracy protests in 2014, said on Twitter that he was urging his followers to join the protest on Wednesday.Pro-democracy activists and legislators and others critical of the extradition bill have insisted they are not satisfied with apologies from the authorities over the handling of the unpopular legislation and over police moves during protests that many Hong Kong residents considered overly aggressive.Hong Kong has a separate legal system from the rest of China under an agreement struck before Beijing took control of the former British colony in 1997. The extradition legislation would enable some suspects to be sent from Hong Kong to stand trial in mainland Chinese courts.The opponents' concern is that suspects might be pursued for corrupt or political reasons and be unable to get fair trials in courts dominated by the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Bonnie Leung, another leader in the Civil Human Rights Front, said the extradition bill, which has been indefinitely shelved for now, would affect not just Hong Kong residents but potentially anyone visiting the city.\"The whole world who have connection with HK would be stakeholders,\" she said. \"This is not about a power struggle. This is about the values that make the world a better place, such as the rule of law.\"\"If you also treasure these values please speak up and do speak up before it is too late,\" she said.Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has apologized over the controversy but refused calls to step down, said the legislation was needed to ensure criminals would not use the territory to evade capture and to meet international standards such as rules against money laundering.", "Latest Hong Kong protest ends peacefully with demands unmet,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,22,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters in Hong Kong besieged police headquarters late into the night Friday, throwing eggs at the building and drawing graffiti on the walls, before ending a day of demonstrations in the Asian financial center with their demands unmet.By daybreak Saturday, police had cleared the streets of barriers set up by protesters to snarl traffic in the Asian financial center, and only a few groups in the mostly youthful crowd remained. Many slept outside the Legislature.Some demonstrators said in TV interviews that they had made their point but were disappointed that neither the police nor government leaders had come to talk to them.Hong Kong has been rocked by major protests for the past two weeks over legislative proposals that many view as eroding the territory's judicial independence and, more broadly, as a sign of Chinese government efforts to chip away at the freedoms of the semi-autonomous city.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely suspended debate on the bills a week ago, making it likely they would die. But protesters are demanding that she formally withdraw the proposed changes to the extradition laws. Some also want her to resign.The peaceful ending to Friday's protests drew a sigh of relief in the city of 7.4 million people, after police unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets last week in violent clashes with protesters that left dozens injured on both sides.Police were previously criticized for their use of force but this time waited out the protesters. Police did issue a statement at 4:50 a.m. condemning them for blocking key streets and seriously disrupting work at police headquarters.\"Police have shown the greatest tolerance to the protesters who assembled outside PHQ, but their means of expressing views have become illegal, irrational and unreasonable,\" the statement said in part.Activist Joshua Wong called on police to answer demands over heavy-handed tactics used during a mass protest on June 12, including the firing of 150 rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, and the beating of unarmed protesters by police with truncheons.\"We ... urge police to apologize to the people\" over the use of such tactics and their labeling of the gathering as a riot, Wong said.While anger seemed to be turning away from civil authorities and toward the police, the mostly black-clad protesters continued to try to shut down the entire government complex, as they have tried off-and-on for the past two weeks.During the afternoon, some sought to build barriers on Connaught Road, the main thoroughfare in the area known as Admiralty, building barriers of stones, pylons and other materials at hand, at one time temporarily blocking in a police van.Around police headquarters, masked and helmeted protesters covered surveillance cameras with masking tape and lashed barriers together with nylon cable ties.The auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong's Catholic diocese, the Rev. Joseph Ha, appealed to the protesters to avoid violence. He warned that public opinion could turn against them.\"You have already been on the roads for a long time,\" he said on Cable TV Hong Kong. \"You've already done a lot. You have already expressed very clearly your hopes and wishes. But I am really worried about your personal safety. ... Please, absolutely, do not use violence.\"Protest leaders have said they are determined to keep up the pressure on Lam, who has insisted the bills are needed to uphold justice. But critics see them as part of a campaign by Beijing to diminish Hong Kong's democratic institutions.\"I myself am not the type to get involved in violence,\" student protester Brian Chow said. \"I'll just carry on sitting here, sing some Christian hymns, show our resistance, and keep the government paralyzed until it responds to us.\"Many protesters have been wary of giving their full names and some have obscured their features with facemasks to guard their identities against potential retribution from government or school authorities.Government offices were ordered closed Friday \"due to security considerations,\" and hearings at the Legislative Council were suspended.Since the confrontations June 12, police have eased their approach, hoping to avoid a replay of 2014 protests, when officers unleashed 87 rounds of tear gas at protesters in the same location as the current protests.When the smoke from that response cleared, bigger crowds returned, angrier than before, and didn't leave for nearly three months.The bills would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include mainland China, Taiwan and Macau. Legal and business groups in Hong Kong oppose the legislation, saying critics of China's ruling Communist Party would be at risk of torture and unfair trials on the mainland and that it further chips away at the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which Hong Kong has been governed since 1997.That framework guaranteed the territory the right to retain its own legal, economic and political system for 50 years, but the Communist Party under Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pushing ever more aggressively to quiet independent voices in Hong Kong. Beijing has squelched all reporting on the protests in mainland media and accused foreign forces of stirring up disturbances in Hong Kong.Opposition to the legislation has come from a broad range of civic, human rights, legal profession and commercial organizations.On Friday, the Hong Kong Bar Association reiterated is criticisms, saying Lam's decision to suspend but not withdraw the bill was \"wholly unsatisfactory\" because it could still dictate the parameters of future consultation on the issues of surrender of fugitives and cross-border legal assistance.The association also called for the setting up of an independent commission to investigate the June 12 violence, including whatever guidelines existed on the use of force by police against demonstrators.Amnesty International went a step further, saying police must \"end the unlawful use of force against peaceful protesters,\" and issuing a report documenting 14 incidents of apparent police violence on June 12.Officers appeared \"out of control, placing peaceful protesters who posed no threat in danger of serious injury,\" Man-kei Tam, the group's Hong Kong director, said in a statement.", "Black-clad protesters demand full withdrawal of extradition bill,REUTERS,June,21,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of people dressed in black rallied in Hong Kong on Friday after the expiry of a deadline protesters set for the government to scrap a controversial extradition bill--the latest wave of protests to rock the Chinese-ruled city.Demonstrators, mostly students, gathered peacefully outside the legislature in sweltering heat of about 30 degrees Celsius to vent their anger and frustration at Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam who promoted, and then postponed the bill after mass protests last week.Some protesters on Friday tried to block key roads near the heart of the financial center in scenes reminiscent of democracy protests in late 2014, sparking early morning traffic chaos.Lam's suspension of the bill, that would allow people to be extradited to the mainland to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, has done little to pacify opponents, who are demanding it be axed.\"We want to fight for our freedom,\" said high school student Chan Pak-lam, 17, outside Hong Kong's political headquarters, which was temporarily shut on Friday due to security concerns.\"We want the law to be withdrawn, not suspended. I will stay here until tonight, 10 p.m. maybe. If the government doesn't respond, we will come again.\"Millions have clogged the streets of the financial hub this month to protest against the extradition bill, which they fear will erode Hong Kong's legal system, triggering some of the most violent protests in decades when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowds.The protesters on Friday demanded the government drop all charges against those arrested during last week's violent protests, charge police with what they describe as violent action and stop referring to the protests as a riot.Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng became the latest government minister to apologize over the bill, which has plunged the former British colony into political turmoil.\"Regarding the controversies and disputes in society arising from the strife in the past few months, being a team member of the government, I offer my sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong,\" Cheng wrote in her blog on Friday.\"We promise to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public.\"Since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including a much-cherished independent judiciary.But many accuse China of obstructing democratic reforms, interfering with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.Embattled Lam has stopped short of axing the bill, unnerving many who fear the law could put them at the mercy of the mainland Chinese justice system which is plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions. Courts in mainland China are controlled by the Communist Party.While Lam admitted shortcomings over the bill and said she has heard the people \"loud and clear,\" she has rejected repeated calls to step down. The snowballing backlash has raised questions over Lam's ability to govern effectively.Concerns over the extradition bill spread quickly from initially democratic and human rights groups to the wider Hong Kong community, including pro-establishment business figures, some usually loath to contradict the government.Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore over the extradition bill.As protesters sat or lay chatting outside the government headquarters, one activist read out a letter sent from a Taiwan student in support of the demonstrators.\"Brave HKers, perhaps when faced with adversity, we are all fragile and small, but please do not give up defending everything that you love, please believe your efforts are meaningful and powerful,\" the protester read through a loud hailer, as the crowds clapped and cheered.Beijing has never renounced the use of force to take over self-ruled Taiwan, which it regards as a recalcitrant, breakaway province. Many have waved Taiwan flags at recent demonstrations in Hong Kong, images certain to rile authorities in Beijing.Taiwan, overwhelmingly opposed to a \"one country, two systems\" formula for itself, has voiced support for Hong Kong.After promises that post-handover Hong Kong should enjoy a high degree of autonomy, Beijing's squeeze has fueled widespread resentment and in 2014 sparked pro-democracy protests that paralyzed parts of the city for 79 days.", "Hong Kong activists urge protesters to register to vote,REUTERS,June,20,2019": "HONG KONG--Campaigners in Hong Kong have registered thousands of new voters during mass protests against controversial extradition law reform, pouncing on an opportunity to bolster the democratic opposition's prospects in upcoming elections.The city's pro-democracy camp needs a strong showing in citywide legislative polls next year to recapture a big enough bloc to veto proposals from pro-establishment rivals, who now dominate the 70-seat legislature.A grassroots district council poll will also be held in November. That has traditionally been heavily swayed by pro-Beijing allies mobilizing supporters across the city.Electoral rules after Hong Kong's 1997 return to China from Britain effectively guarantee that the legislature, known as Legco, is stacked in Beijing's favor, with only half the parliament directly elected.But in the current controversy, public anger has centered on Beijing-backed Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her allies in trying to ram through the unpopular extradition bill, nudging many previously neutral citizens to take a stand.\"I'm not even registered because, honestly, before, I felt like they don't need one more person,\" said 24-year-old Christine Man, who filled out her first voter registration form at a rally against the extradition bill. \"If all of us stand up, it is a lot.\"Demonstrations last week, marred by violence, were followed by a march on Sunday that organizers said drew nearly 2 million people opposed to the bill, which would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China.At the Sunday march, singer and activist Denise Ho and volunteers from her NGO, Reimagine Hong Kong, collected and submitted about 3,000 voter registration forms, and handed out another 12,000. Registration drives are uncommon in Hong Kong, she said.\"For the people, this moment is very critical,\" Ho told Reuters.Hong Kong's 18 district councils don't formulate policy but control public spending at the local level. They are also training grounds for up-and-coming politicians, said Samson Yuen, an associate professor of political science at Lingnan University.The district councils are dominated by pro-Beijing parties.Winning district councils could help boost representation in the 1,200 member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive.Half of Legco's 70 seats are popularly elected and the rest are picked by business and professional groups called \"functional constituencies,\" which are dominated by pro-Beijing figures.In 2016, the pan-democratic camp won 29 seats--more than enough to wield veto power--but then lost six when these candidates were disqualified after China's national parliament ruled their oaths of office were invalid.About 2.2 million people voted in that election, or 58 percent of total registered voters, government data show. Less than 1.5 million people, or 47 percent of registered voters, cast ballots in district council elections the year before.The legislature \"is a very important battleground for us because it's a firewall between the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Chinese government, which is controlling everything,\" Ho said, referring to the territory's mini-Constitution.Ho, who is also an LGBT activist and staunch supporter of the pro-democracy Occupy movement, is continuing the push to enlist new voters ahead of the July 2 deadline for registration for the district council polls.About 30 local shops have said they would offer registration forms to customers, and Reimagine Hong Kong volunteers plan to set up 12 booths around the city to try to sign up more voters.Ho says that her star power has helped the campaign, but that drawing other entertainers into the effort has been tough because most in Hong Kong rely on the mainland market, where Ho has been banned since supporting the protests in 2014.Most of the demonstrators have been relatively young, and youth are under-represented among the electorate, Ho said. They are also potentially sympathetic to the pro-democracy parties, while the pro-Beijing camp's base includes more older citizens.Hong Kong's embattled leader, Lam, apologized this week for her government's poor handling of the extradition controversy and said she would redouble her engagement with youths.But critics say that is not enough and are continuing the fight.\"I'm quite sure, given what is happening right now, the pro-democracy camp will definitely have an upper hand,\" Yuen said of the upcoming elections.How big a boost the pro-democracy camp will get remains to be seen.\"This protest has been against the extradition bill. There is no political ideology or ideas of where this is going. People are not even talking about universal suffrage or resulting political reform. It's a very defensive movement,\" Yuen said.Man, the would-be new voter, said the extradition saga has been a catalyst in her political awakening.\"I know that Hong Kong is a part of China, and I'm not saying that we should be independent. But at least we can vote for the people that we would like to speak for us,\" Man said. \"Carrie Lam--is she listening? I don't think she is listening.\"", "Hong Kong lawmakers raise complaints over police brutality,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,19,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong lawmakers grilled the city's security secretary Wednesday over allegations of police brutality during protests over an extradition bill that eventually was suspended.The agenda for the meeting showed that pro-democracy members were planning to file a motion of no-confidence for Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the legislation, which sparked the demonstrations over recent weeks including a massive march on Sunday.The opposition lawmakers were wearing black with white ribbons pinned to their lapels. They put white chrysanthemums, another symbol of mourning, on their desks, and observed a few moments of silence in mourning for a protester who died in a fall last weekend.Security Secretary John Lee rejected suggestions that he should resign to take responsibility for police use of aggressive tactics, including beatings with steel batons and heavy use of tear gas. He also defended the decisions made on the scene.Pro-democracy lawmaker Gary Fan said that police encircled some protesters without warning and fired four rounds of tear gas. The demonstrators fled into a building, \"they ran for their lives,\" Fan said.\"The people didn't have anywhere to escape from the scene,\" he said. \"How can this be a minimal use of force?\"Lee reiterated Lam's insistence that the complaints against police would be handled through agencies established to handle such issues.Lam formally apologized Tuesday and said she was responsible for the extradition bill mess. The fact that she did not shed tears or bow in apology was front page news, with many in Hong Kong criticizing what they said was an apparent lack of contrition.The motion of no-confidence against Lam was likely to be voted down or boycotted by the majority pro-government legislators. Most did not show up for the questioning session over complaints against police.Critics of the extradition bill, which would allow some suspects to be extradited to stand trial in mainland courts, want Lam to permanently withdraw the legislation and to step down. They also are demanding the government guarantee that protest participants not be unfairly accused of rioting if they did not commit crimes.Beijing-appointed Lam would only say she would not revive the bill without certainty of its acceptance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 signaling that it has been shelved indefinitely.Many in Hong Kong fear a further weakening of this former British colony's legal autonomy, promised for 50 years after Beijing took over in 1997, at a time when Communist-ruled China is growing increasingly authoritarian.One concern is that the law might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.Lam has insisted the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.Samson Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, said the extradition bill is like a \"knife at the throat\" for many in Hong Kong.\"There's a lot of energy, emotion and passion and also anger,\" he said in an interview. \"It's a total mobilization of society.\"", "Hong Kong leader: Extradition bill unlikely to be revived,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's leader apologized Tuesday for an unpopular extradition bill that drew massive protests and indicated that it will not be revived during the current legislative session.But Chief Executive Carrie Lam did not formally retract the legislation. She also said she hopes to finish her term, shrugging away calls for her resignation.Lam acknowledged that it was unlikely she could win public trust in the bill, which would allow some suspects to face trial in mainland Chinese courts.\"In recognition of the anxiety and fears caused by the bill in the last few months, if we don't have confidence from the people we will not proceed with the legislative exercise again,\" Lam said.\"I will not proceed with this legislative exercise if these fears and anxieties could not be adequately addressed,\" she said.The bill ignited several massive protests, including a march by nearly 2 million people on Sunday and by as many as 1 million people a week earlier.Activists rejected Lam's earlier apologies for her handling of the legislation, which touched a nerve not easily soothed in a city anxious over the increasingly authoritarian Communist rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping.The uproar also has highlighted worries that Hong Kong is losing the special autonomous status China promised it when it took control from Britain in 1997.Scenes at the protests were similar to demonstrations in 2014, when people camped for weeks in the streets demanding direct elections of the city's chief executive, who is chosen by a pro-Beijing committee.One concern over the extradition bill is that it might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.Lam insists the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.So far, China has been excluded from Hong Kong's extradition agreements because of concerns over the independence of its courts and its human rights record.The vast majority of Hong Kong residents fled persecution, political chaos or poverty and famine on the Chinese mainland. They value stability and but also cherish freedoms of dissent and legal protections not allowed for people on the mainland.", "ANALYSIS: China blinks on Hong Kong, but divide remains,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,18,2019": "BEIJING--The leader of China, it turns out, may not be all-powerful.Faced with huge and disruptive protests in Hong Kong, China blinked. The decision to shelve the legislation that sparked the demonstrations shows that limits still exist to how hard China can, or is willing, to push. It also exposed a fundamental contradiction in the \"one country, two systems\" framework that governs the semi-autonomous city.Chinese President Xi Jinping has cemented his hold on power since taking the helm in 2012. His government has expanded control over information, religion and other aspects of society. In Hong Kong, the local government has disqualified a pro-independence party, sent the leaders of a 2014 protest to prison and denied a visa renewal to an editor for Britain's Financial Times.Activists decried these moves as chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms, but residents largely went about their lives. Then the government, with China's backing, chipped too deeply, propelling hundreds of thousands, possibly millions in a city of 7.4 million people, into the streets.For Xi, it apparently tipped the scales in a balancing act between attempts to tighten Communist authority and stability in the international financial center, and wanting to keep Hong Kong from slipping out of Beijing's control--and even demanding independence.\"It is a sign that Xi Jinping's government is not totally impervious to pressure, despite the fact that he has consolidated so much power,\" said Ben Bland, an expert at the Lowy Institute in Australia and author of \"Generation HK: Seeking Identity in China's Shadow.\"It was in an atmosphere of uneasiness about China's intentions that Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, proposed changes to extradition laws that would allow Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to mainland China to face trial. The Chinese government supported the proposals, though it insisted that the idea was Lam's, not theirs.The idea ignited simmering concern about Chinese influence and Hong Kong's future. For many, the idea of being tried under the mainland legal system threw into question the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which the British returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 and that guarantees the city's right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years.It's a framework that has been tested repeatedly in the ensuing two decades and stems from an intractable problem in China's approach to Hong Kong. As China expert Kevin Carrico notes, the leader of Hong Kong is not elected democratically, as activists demand. Lam was chosen by a committee dominated by supporters of China's ruling Communist Party. She is beholden to the Chinese government, not the people of Hong Kong.So Lam persevered despite a massive protest on June 9, and then clashes between police and demonstrators outside the legislature on Wednesday. She finally gave in on Saturday, but not enough to stop another huge protest on Sunday whose turnout may have exceeded that of June 9.Carrico, a senior lecturer in Chinese Studies at Monash University in Australia, called the protests a testament to a failure of Xi's hard-line approach to Hong Kong. That includes a shift away from responding to or acknowledging the demands of protesters in Hong Kong, starting with the \"Umbrella Movement\" pro-democracy protests in 2014.That doesn't mean China will stop trying to control Hong Kong, as the balancing act continues.\"The Chinese government is determined to stop what it sees as the use of Two Systems to undermine the unity of One Country,\" Bland said. \"And Hong Kongers are clearly determined to fight for their freedoms.\"What is happening today in Hong Kong parallels what happened in 2003, when huge protests forced the government to drop a proposal to impose what opponents saw as a draconian national security law modeled on China's.Eventually, China's then-hand-picked leader resigned, but the fundamental issue remained, and protests returned in 2012, 2014 and this year.\"There's this constant cycle that is really a product of the way the chief executives of Hong Kong are elected,\" Carrico said.Xi and China may have beat a retreat, but the difference between what the two sides want suggests the pattern of government proposal and massive protest could well play out again in years to come.", "China stands by Hong Kong leader after days of street protests,REUTERS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--China redoubled its support for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Monday after days of protests against a planned extradition bill, and a source close to Lam said Beijing was unlikely to let her go even if she tried to resign.Lam's attempts to pass a bill that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China for trial triggered the biggest and most violent protests in decades in the former British colony, now under Chinese rule.As the crisis entered its second week, demonstrators and opposition politicians braved intermittent rain to gather near the government's offices and urge her to kill the bill and quit.The upheaval comes at a delicate time for Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is grappling with a deepening U.S. trade war, slowing economic growth and regional strategic tension.Hong Kong has been governed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula since its return to Chinese rule in 1997, enjoying freedoms not granted to the mainland, including an independent judiciary but short of a fully democratic vote.Many residents are increasingly unnerved by Beijing's tightening grip and what they see as the erosion of those freedoms. Many say changes to the rule of law could imperil Hong Kong's status as a global financial center.\"The Chinese government, the central government, has always fully affirmed the work of chief executive Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong government,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a news conference in Beijing.\"The central government will continue to firmly support the chief executive and the SAR government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governing in accordance with the law,\" he said, referring to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.Hong Kong police said late on Monday that 32 people had been arrested since Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters.Protest organizers said almost 2 million people--out of a population of around 7 million--turned out on Sunday to demand that Lam resign, in what is becoming the most significant challenge to China's relationship with the territory since 1997.The mass rally, which police said drew 338,000 participants at its peak, forced Lam to apologize for planning to push the bill through.On Monday, protesters near the government's offices blocked roads and urged Lam to withdraw the bill, release arrested students, drop the official description of a rally on Wednesday that involved clashes with the police as a riot, and step down.A senior Hong Kong official close to Lam told Reuters that Beijing was not likely to let her do so, even if she wanted to, saying \"it would create more problems than it solves, at all sorts of levels.\"Lam stopped short of explicitly killing the bill, but the official said the postponement meant it was effectively dead.Still, many in Hong Kong are unhappy to have faced the prospect of legislation that lawyers and judges say risks exposing people to the mercy of a mainland justice system plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention.The bill would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living there or passing through.\"We cannot accept her apology, it doesn't remove all our threats,\" said social worker Brian Chau, one of several hundred protesters who stayed overnight in the Admiralty district around the government headquarters and legislature.In a coincidence of timing, 22-year-old Joshua Wong, the face of Hong Kong's push for full democracy, walked free from prison on Monday.\"I will join to fight against this evil law,\" said Wong, one of the leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" protests that blocked major roads for 79 days. \"I believe this is the time for her, Carrie Lam the liar, to step down.\"Two former post-colonial leaders, Tung Chee-Hwa and Leung Chun-ying, were forced to cut short their time in office amid controversies linked to policies that stoked fears of Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong's freedoms.The latest crisis escalated during Wong's five-week jail term for contempt of court. Until this month, the failure of the Umbrella protests to win concessions, coupled with prosecutions of at least 100 protesters, had discouraged many young people from going back out on the streets.But Lam's efforts to ram through the extradition bill galvanized opposition.On Monday, the benchmark share index climbed 0.4%, having risen more than 1% in early trade, outperforming gains in Asia ex-Japan and onshore China.Opposition politicians echoed marchers' calls for both Lam and the proposed law to go.\"Her government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,\" veteran Democratic Party legislator James To told government-funded broadcaster RTHK.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump was likely to raise the issue of Hong Kong human rights with China's Xi if they met at the G-20 summit in Japan next week.British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said she would raise the protests with Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, who is on a visit to London to boost economic and financial cooperation.", "Protesters demand that embattled Hong Kong leader resign,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--Demonstrators in Hong Kong gathered Monday outside the office of the city's leader, demanding that she step down in the crisis over a highly unpopular extradition bill that has tested the durability of China's promises to respect the former British colony's quasi-autonomy.The mostly young protesters blocked a street near the city's waterfront as they stood outside the office of Chief Executive Carrie Lam chanting calls for her to cancel the proposed legislation.As night fell, protest leaders debated their next steps. Some wanted to set a deadline for a meeting with Lam. Others decided to head home.Nearly 2 million Hong Kong residents, young and old, joined a march on Sunday that lasted late into the night to express their frustrations with Lam and the extradition bill, backed by Beijing. Many stayed on afterward.Protesters blocked some downtown roads well into Monday morning, but gradually yielded to police requests to reopen roads, moving to areas near the city's government headquarters. The protest revived after Joshua Wong, a prominent activist leader, rallied the crowd after his release from prison later Monday.The activists have rejected apologies from Lam for her handling of the legislation, which would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. She announced that work on the bill would be suspended after large protests last week, but the legislation has touched a nerve not easily soothed in a city anxious over the increasingly authoritarian Communist rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\"We are very angry that Carrie Lam has not responded to the demands of all the protesters, but now is the time to talk about strategy, and talk about strategy is about how to make the whole struggle into a long-term struggle and not a day struggle, so if Carrie Lam does not respond to the demands by the protesters, people will come back and the struggle will continue,\" Lee Cheuk-yan, a former legislator and activist, said Monday.The uproar over the extradition bill highlights worries that the former British colony is losing the special autonomous status China promised it when it took control in 1997.On June 9, a week earlier, as many as 1 million people demonstrated to express their concern over Hong Kong's relations with mainland China.The scenes are similar to those in 2014, when protesters camped for weeks in the streets to protest rules that prevented the direct election of the city's chief executive.Wong, who was imprisoned for his role in the 2014 demonstrations and sit-ins, dubbed the \"Umbrella Movement,\" was released from prison on Monday after serving half of a two-month sentence on a contempt charge. He soon swapped his white shirt for one that was black--the color of this year's protests--and joined the fray.\"After the end of the Umbrella Movement we claimed we would be back. Finally five years later we did it,\" Wong said.\"It's lucky that Beijing and Carrie Lam transformed a whole generation of youngsters from normal citizens to dissidents. That's the price that Beijing must pay,\" Wong said.One concern over the extradition bill is that it might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.It's seen as one of many steps chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms and legal autonomy.Lam insists the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice, meet its international obligations and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.So far, China has been excluded from Hong Kong's extradition agreements because of concerns over the judicial independence of its courts and its human rights record.The vast majority of Hong Kong residents fled persecution, political chaos or famine in the Chinese mainland. They value stability and but also cherish freedoms of dissent and legal protections not allowed Chinese living across the border.Many Hong Kong residents also were angered over the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government's headquarters during demonstrations on Wednesday, and over Lam's decision to call the clashes a riot. That worsens the potential legal consequences for those involved.The city's police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-chung, said late Monday that only those found to have committed violent acts would be charged with rioting, in an apparent attempt to appease the anger.Although he also described the fracas as a riot, he said only five of 15 arrested people were accused of rioting, which can result in a prison term of up to 10 years. Another 17 people were arrested in the vicinity on lesser charges, he said.The protesters have mainly focused their ire toward Lam, who has little choice but to carry through dictates issued by Beijing. She has sidestepped questions over whether she should quit and also defended how the police dealt with last week's clashes.Many here believe Hong Kong's legal autonomy has been significantly diminished despite Beijing's insistence that it is still honoring its promise, dubbed \"one country, two systems,\" that the territory can retain its own social, legal and political system for 50 years after the handover from Britain in 1997.Prosecutions of activists, detentions without trial of five Hong Kong book publishers and the illegal seizure in Hong Kong by mainland agents of at least one mainland businessman are among moves in recent years that have unnerved many in the city of 7 million.", "With sense of unease, Taiwan rallies behind Hongkongers,By HIDESHI NISHIMOTO/ Correspondent,June,17,2019": "TAIPEI--Concerns are growing here that the turmoil Hong Kong has been thrown into over controversial extradition legislation may be a reflection of things to come.Protesters hit the streets here on June 16 in an expression of solidarity with millions of marchers who filled the streets of Hong Kong the same day in large-scale protests now in their second week.Passage of the extradition legislation would allow authorities to send some suspects to China, where opponents worry they may face torture and unfair trials.Several hundred protesters gathered in front of the Legislative Yuan building in Taipei, reflecting a deepened concern among Taiwanese that \"today's Hong Kong will be tomorrow's Taiwan,\" a key phrase of the rally.Office worker Liu Bo-jing, 30, who attended the protest with his friends, said: \"China's next target is Taiwan. I worry about being caught up in this.\"The slogan originates in a 2014 \"Sunflower Student Movement\" in Taiwan, during which activists occupied the Legislative Yuan and government facilities in protest of the Ma Ying-jeou government, led by the China-friendly Kuomintang (Nationalist Party).Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a speech in January that he would not rule out the use of force for reunification with Taiwan and proposed a \"one country, two systems\" principle to the region.With presidential elections set for next January in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen said on June 10, the second day of protests in Hong Kong, \"If we were to accept such a system, we would lose our freedom, democracy and human rights.\"Tsai, who is seeking to stay in office, has made efforts to expand support by using such fundamental concerns among Taiwanese as a springboard.Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, who is seen as a strong candidate of the opposition Kuomintang, has called for improved ties with China. He recently met in March with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.When asked by Taiwan media about the crisis in Hong Kong, Han responded simply, \"I don't know,\" generating criticism from Taiwan citizens.Under fire in Hong Kong, Lam suspended efforts to enact the extradition bill on June 15.", "Hong Kong rich start moving assets offshore as fears rise,REUTERS,June,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore as concern deepens over a local government plan to allow extraditions of suspects to face trial in China for the first time, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with such transactions.One tycoon, who considers himself potentially politically exposed, has started shifting more than $100 million (10.8 billion yen) from a local Citibank account to a Citibank account in Singapore, according to an adviser involved in the transactions.\"It's started. We're hearing others are doing it, too, but no-one is going to go on parade that they are leaving,\" the adviser said. \"The fear is that the bar is coming right down on Beijing's ability to get your assets in Hong Kong. Singapore is the favored destination.\"Hong Kong and Singapore compete fiercely to be considered Asia's premier financial center. The riches held by Hong Kong's tycoons have until now made the city the larger base for private wealth, boasting 853 individuals worth more than $100 million--just over double the number in Singapore--according to a 2018 report from Credit Suisse.The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, has sparked unusually broad concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong's international financial status. Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, has stood by the bill, saying it is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said the courts would safeguard human rights.Protests and violence forced an initial legislative debate to be shelved last Wednesday and it is unclear when they would resume to pass the bill.Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school, told Reuters that it was understandable that some Hong Kong residents might be considering moving assets out of the city given the little-noticed financial reach of the bill.If the bill becomes law, it will be possible for mainland Chinese courts to request Hong Kong courts to freeze and confiscate assets related to crimes committed on the mainland, beyond an existing provision covering the proceeds of drug offenses. \"This has been largely overlooked in the public debate but it is really a significant part of the proposed amendments,\" Young said. \"It may not have been overlooked, of course, by the tycoons and those giving them legal advice.\"The head of the private banking operations of an international bank in Hong Kong, who declined to be named, said clients have been moving money out of Hong Kong to Singapore. \"These aren't mainland Chinese clients who might be politically exposed, but wealthy Hong Kong clients,\" the banker said. \"The situation in Hong Kong is out of control. They can't believe that Carrie Lam or Beijing leaders are so stupid that they don't realize the economic damage from this.\"A Hong Kong government spokesman did not directly address Reuters' questions over capital flight, but said Hong Kong's \"world class financial infrastructure\" and open, international market had a regulatory regime \"completely compatible with that of overseas markets.\"The amendments seek to simplify case-by-case extraditions to jurisdictions, including mainland China, beyond the 20 with which Hong Kong already has extradition treaties.As well as removing an explicit block on extraditions to mainland China in the current Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the amendments also remove the restrictions on the mainland from the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance, known as the MLAO.According to a recent Hong Kong Bar Association study, the MLAO allows foreign jurisdictions to ask Hong Kong authorities to gather evidence for use outside the city \"and to render other forms of assistance, such as freezing and confiscating the assets of persons wanted for crimes in other jurisdictions.\"Search, seizure and confiscation can involve cases with a penalty of two years in prison or more, compared with the threshold of seven years for extraditions under the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the submission notes. Requests can also be made at the investigative rather than prosecution stage.The association notes that the mutual legal assistance amendments would \"significantly strengthen the impact of the amended Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in relation to criminal prosecutions on the mainland.\"The Hong Kong government spokesman noted that any external confiscation order had to be registered in a Hong Kong court and could be challenged. It had to meet a \"double criminality\" standard, whereby it had to be based on conduct that was also a crime in Hong Kong.\"The rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people and foreigners in Hong Kong, including their assets, are fully protected by the Basic Law,\" the spokesman added, referring to Hong Kong's mini-Constitution.Prominent commercial lawyer Kevin Yam said he was aware of high net-worth Hong Kong figures taking steps to move assets to Singapore as they matured or market conditions proved favorable.\"At this point I would say it is a steady trickle rather than stampede but is most definitely happening,\" he said.Three other private bankers said they had received inquiries from clients about the impact of the bill, but had not yet seen the funds move.Yam said few expected the bill to be widely exploited by Beijing overnight if passed, but it was creating a climate of deep unease, with the fear it could be used more liberally in coming years.\"It is great for Singapore,\" he said. \"And such an own goal for Hong Kong.\"", "VOX POPULI: Hong Kong protesters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fight evokes images of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Attack on Titan\u00e2\u0080\u0099,Vox Populi, Vox Dei is a daily column that runs on Page 1 of The Asahi Shimbun.,June,17,2019": "I still recall how excited I felt the first time I read \u00e2\u0080\u009cShingeki no kyojin\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Attack on Titan), an enormously popular Japanese manga series.Humans reside in uneasy peace in a community protected by three enormous walls. Outside the walls is a wasteland swarming with giant humanoid creatures called Titans that devour people.When the walls are finally broken, people band together to fight back against the gigantic monsters.In 2014, Hong Kong's youth apparently found an intriguing analogy between them and the embattled humans in the manga series.Some of the young people who took part in the pro-democracy demonstrations that year against Chinese efforts to tighten control over the former British colony referred to episodes of the manga.Tens of thousands of people joined the Umbrella Movement protests, using umbrellas to shield themselves against police tear gas and pepper spray, and occupying major roads for almost three months.Five years later, Hong Kong is being roiled again by large-scale, spirited demonstrations, described as a reincarnation of the movement.This time, people in the city are fighting the so-called fugitives bill, designed to enable authorities to extradite criminal suspects to China.Critics fear Beijing could use the proposed legislation to seize anyone in the territory at will and whisk them off to China on trumped-up charges for trial in the country's Communist Party-controlled courts.For anyone who has read \u00e2\u0080\u009cAttack on Titan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this prospect is likely to conjure up images of giants dragging humans off to the wasteland they inhabit.Under the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d governance model, freedom of speech is guaranteed in Hong Kong, where the judiciary is supposed to be independent of politics.But the bill is threatening to break one of the walls that protects freedom in Hong Kong.For the Chinese authorities, the walls are nothing but obstacles to their political agenda. But they can also serve as mirrors that reflect the absurdities of the dictatorship in China.The wave of protests is putting huge pressure on Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government.

Protesters, many in masks and other gear to guard against possible use of tear gas, responded with chants, some kneeling in front of the officers. The move came after activists rejected an apology from the city's top leader for her handling of legislation that has stoked fears of expanding control from Beijing in this former British colony.Groups of police, most in normal uniforms not riot gear, sought to clear the roads of metal and plastic barricades to enable traffic to pass through. In some places, the protesters quickly moved to put them back to block traffic.Hundreds of protesters were sitting or lying along a main road through downtown, but they were scattered over a relatively wide area.Activists called on Hong Kong residents to boycott classes and work, though it was unclear how many might heed that call.Nearly 2 million of the city's 7 million people turned out on Sunday, according to estimates by protest organizers.

Few wore face masks or seemed to be trying to hide their identities, in contrast with demonstrations Wednesday, when participants expressed worries over possible retribution from the authorities.Protesters also are angry over the way police used tear gas, rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government's headquarters in that smaller but more aggressive protest.The police presence on Sunday was considerably more relaxed, with officers deployed mainly to direct traffic as the protesters wound their way through Hong Kong's commercial center from a sprawling downtown park to government headquarters.Farther down the parade route, mourners lined up to lay flowers and pay respects at a makeshift memorial for a man who fell to his death Saturday after hanging a protest banner that read in part, \"Make Love, No Shoot\" and \"No Extradition to China.\"The man slipped from the grasp of rescuers after clinging for a time to scaffolding outside a shopping mall. He missed a large cushion set up to capture him and was declared dead at a nearby hospital.Many protesters wore ribbons on their shirts and carried placards showing protesters who had been beaten bloody last week.Pro-democracy activists were calling for a general strike on Monday despite Lam's decision to suspend work on the legislation. Some labor unions, teachers' associations and other groups were planning boycotts of work and classes, demanding the Lam administration retire the proposed amendments and not bring them up again for passage at a later stage.\"We encourage all the public to carry on the campaign,\" said Bonnie Leung, a leader of the pro-democracy group Civil Human Rights Front. \"If any new violence takes place, it will be the responsibility of the police.\"The Communist Party-ruled mainland took control in 1997 with a promise not to interfere with the city's civil liberties and courts.

On Saturday, she appeared to be fighting for her political life as she sought to explain her decision to push through unpopular legislation that would make it easier to extradite suspects to communist-ruled mainland China, which took control of the territory in a 1997 handover.A key reason for Lam's vulnerability is that she was not directly elected by the territory's people, but rather ushered into office in 2017 by the vote of a 1,194-member committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites--despite being far less popular than her main rival.She now finds herself caught between a public that never truly backed her, and leaders in Beijing who want her to push through unpopular measures seen to be eroding Western-style economic, social and cultural freedoms that Beijing promised to respect for at least 50 years after it took back control from Britain.Lam, 62, has a reputation as an efficient and pragmatic administrator. But she was unpopular with Hong Kongers even before she took office because she was seen as a proxy for Beijing who was out of touch with ordinary people.She said Saturday that she was shelving the extradition bill to avoid further social turmoil following a protest march that drew hundreds of thousands of people on June 9 and violent clashes on Wednesday where police used tear gas, rubber bullets and other tactics, angering the public further.Lam's insistence that she had the full backing of China's central government in taking her decision likely rang as tone-deaf given skepticism over the communist leadership's motives, especially after a deadly crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square three decades ago.\"They understand, they have confidence in my judgment and they support me,\" Lam told reporters, while also saying the legislation was still needed.Hours later, Bonny Leung, a leader with a pro-democracy alliance, accused Lam of \"ignorance and arrogance.\" She and other activists urged Hong Kong citizens to turn out en-masse for a march Sunday to demand the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, an apology for the aggressive police tactics and Lam's resignation as chief executive.Few anticipated that Lam would become embroiled in such friction when she took over from her predecessor Leung Chun-ying, a highly polarizing former policeman who stepped down as chief executive in 2017, citing family reasons.Lam may eventually, after a face-saving interval, also end up stepping aside, analysts said. That would allow time for Beijing to decide upon a successor that the leadership considers both competent and politically reliable.\"They may not fire her immediately, but her chances for a second term are totally gone now and they may find a reason to let her go without losing much face because now she is hated by everybody in Hong Kong and her administration has become quite ungovernable,\" said Willy Lam, a veteran political observer.Carrie Lam is Hong Kong's first female leader and its fourth since Britain ended its colonial rule in 1997. While the Chinese government in Beijing has condemned foreign criticism of the protests over the extradition bill as meddling in the country's internal affairs, they've largely remained aloof from the controversy in Hong Kong, preferring to let Lam take the heat or even make her a scapegoat, according to some analysts.China's ambassador to Britain told the BBC the push to fast-track the extradition bill was entirely Lam's idea.Unlike many in the top ranks of Hong Kong's leadership, Lam comes from a humble background. She grew up in the downtown Wanchai district, the fourth of five children. She attended a Catholic girls school, the University of Hong Kong and later Cambridge University.She is married to a mathematician and has two sons. They are British citizens, but Lam is not.Much of the unhappiness with Lam and her administration predates her appointment as chief executive. Protests in 2014 over rules Beijing imposed for choosing members of the election committee that helps select the chief executive paralyzed parts of the city for weeks.The protests, dubbed the Umbrella Movement, highlighted Hong Kong aspirations for greater, rather than less democracy.On taking office, Lam pledged to focus on issues such as housing, education and health care. In pushing for the extradition bill, she ignited public frustrations over increasing control by Beijing.In speaking to reporters on Saturday, Lam insisted she only wants what's good for Hong Kong.\"We have not done a good enough job to convince the people of Hong Kong,\" she said. \"Give us another chance.\"", "Hong Kong leader suspends\u00e3\u0080\u0080extradition bill after protests,REUTERS,June,15,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday delayed indefinitely a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China, in a dramatic retreat after widespread anger over the bill sparked the biggest street protests in three decades.The extradition bill, which would cover Hong Kong's 7 million residents as well as foreign and Chinese nationals in the city, was seen by many as a threat to the rule of law in the former British colony.Around a million people marched through Hong Kong last Sunday to oppose the bill, according to protest organizers, the largest since protests in the city against the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations centered around Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.Demonstrations continued through the week and were met with tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets from police, plunging the city into turmoil and piling heavy pressure on Lam.\"After repeated internal deliberations over the last two days, I now announce that the government has decided to suspend the legislative amendment exercise, restart our communication with all sectors of society, do more explanation work and listen to different views of society,\" Lam told a news conference.She said there was no deadline, effectively suspending the process indefinitely.The about-face was one of the most significant political turnarounds under public pressure by the Hong Kong government since Britain returned the territory to China in 1997, and it threw into question Lam's ability to continue to lead the city.But it potentially alleviated an unwanted headache for the leadership in Beijing, which is grappling with a slowing economy and a simmering trade war with the United States.Asked repeatedly if she would step down, Lam avoided directly answering and appealed to the public to \"give us another chance\". She said she had been a civil servant for decades and still had work she wanted to do.The extradition bill deliberations started in February and Lam had pushed to have it passed by July. Backing down was unthinkable last week when the law's passage seemed inevitable as Lam remained defiant.But the protests changed the equation.Cracks began to appear on Friday in the support base for the bill with several pro-Beijing politicians and a senior adviser to Lam saying discussion of the bill should be postponed for the time being.Lam had not appeared in public or commented since Wednesday. She met pro-Beijing lawmakers to explain her pending announcement earlier on Saturday.Sing Tao newspaper reported that China's top official overseeing Hong Kong policy, Vice Premier Han Zheng, met Lam in Shenzhen in recent days.Lam declined to confirm whether or not the meeting had happened, but took ownership for the decision to suspend the bill and said she had support from the central government.She stopped short of apologizing, saying she felt \"deep sorrow and regret that the deficiencies in our work and various other factors have stirred up substantial controversies and disputes in society\".Beyond the public outcry, the extradition bill had spooked some of Hong Kong's tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details.And senior police officers have said Lam's refusal to heed public opinion was sowing resentment in the force, which was already battered by accusations of police brutality during the 2014 pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" civil disobedience movement.Michael Tien, a member of Hong Kong's legislature and a deputy to China's national parliament, said a total withdrawal of the bill would not be possible.\"The amendment is supported by the central government, so I think a withdrawal would send a political message that the central government is wrong. This would not happen under 'one country, two systems',\" he told Reuters, referring to the model under which Hong Kong enjoys semi-autonomy.Organisers of last Sunday's protest march are planning another march this Sunday.In addition to calling for the bill to be completely dropped, they would also be pushing for accountability of the police for the way protests have been handled.Lam has said the extradition law is necessary to prevent criminals using Hong Kong as a place to hide and that human rights will be protected by the city's court which will decide on the extraditions on a case-by-case basis.Critics, including leading lawyers and rights groups, note that China's justice system is controlled by the Communist Party, and marked by torture and forced confessions, arbitrary detention and poor access to lawyers.Hong Kong is governed by China under a \"one country, two systems\" deal that guarantees it special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary.Many accuse Beijing of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders.The Chinese government has denied that it has overreached in Hong Kong.", "Tokyo marchers show support for Hong Kongers in fight for liberty,By SOTARO HATA/ Staff Writer,June,14,2019": "Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Tokyo on June 13 in support of millions of young people in Hong Kong voicing opposition to legislation that would allow political offenders to be extradited to China.Assembling in front of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region building in the capital's Chiyoda Ward, the protestors chanted, \"Hong Kong, hang in there.\"The gathering was organized by Jinshiro Motoyama, 27, a former member of Students Emergency Action for Liberal Democracy-s (SEALDs), a now-dissolved social activist association.SEALDs launched a campaign against national security bills of the Abe administration before they were passed in September 2015.\"It's totally unacceptable that (young people in Hong Kong) are having their self-determination taken away,\" Motoyama said during the demonstration. \"We want to give them encouragement as a group that shares the same values of liberty and democracy.\"Some people from Hong Kong also participated in the demonstration, with one 21-year-old student saying, \"I'm delighted that Japanese people are showing their support for us.\"\"If I criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hong Kong, I could be arrested. It's frightening,\" she added.During the demonstration, Motoyama spoke to the participants, saying: \"I called for this gathering on my Twitter account, saying, 'Let's link arms with those who are in protest. Let's do what we can in Tokyo or Japan.' I'm happy to see that so many people have gathered. I would like my friends in the demonstration in Hong Kong to be inspired by what is happening here.\"Motoyama has been in contact with young people in Hong Kong who supported the pro-democracy protest movement known as the \"Umbrella Revolution,\" which called for the implementation of democratic elections in the region.", "Taiwan leader Tsai gets party nod to run for re-election,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,14,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, a thorn in the side of China's government because of her pro-independence views, sewed up the ruling party's nomination Thursday to seek a second four-year term after a tense primary race.She outperformed her opponent in three days of opinion polling, setting herself up to be named as the Democratic Progressive Party's candidate in the January 2020 election.Tsai's tough stance against Chinese pressure to reunite with the mainland has driven up once-sagging approval ratings. Her nomination is all but sure to be ratified by the party next week.She has sought public favor by strengthening the military and cultivating ties with the United States, said Huang Kwei-bo, vice dean of the international affairs college at National Chengchi University.\"Tsai Ing-wen is continuously saying 'I'm going to protect Taiwan and stand up for autonomy and make the most of foreign relations,'\" he said.Her government has helped break ground on a submarine manufacturing site, accepted high-level visits from the United States and received American military support, including seven U.S. Navy ship passages over the past year through the strait dividing China from Taiwan.China criticizes the high-level visits and the naval ship passages.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in January that the two sides should be ruled like Hong Kong, which is grappling with mass street protests targeting Chinese control. Hong Kong is part of China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework that gives the territory some local autonomy.More than 80 percent of Taiwanese said in a government survey in January that they prefer self-rule over merging with China.\"What Taiwanese feel most deeply about this is that 'one-country, two systems' is not viable and not acceptable for a democratic Taiwan,\" Tsai told reporters Thursday afternoon after her secretary general met with Hong Kong students at the presidential office.The Democratic Progressive Party, which embraces more autonomy for Taiwan instead of a tie-up with China, announced that Tsai had defeated her only challenger, former Premier William Lai, in three days of opinion polling.Tsai received approval from 35.7 percent of the roughly 15,000 people polled against Lai's 27.5 percent, party Chairman Cho Jung-tai said.In response to her victory, Tsai called later Thursday for \"uniting all our power that can be united\" to \"defend Taiwan.\"Tsai will go up against a candidate from the opposition Nationalist Party, which advocates closer relations with Beijing.Possible Nationalist candidates include Terry Gou, chairman of the world's largest consumer electronics assembler, Foxconn Technology, and Han Kuo-yu, the populist mayor of southern port city Kaohsiung.Tsai fell below 30 percent in public opinion polls last year as Taiwanese worried about inaction toward China as well as domestic economic issues such as jobs and housing prices.Tsai upsets Beijing because she rejects its dialogue condition that both sides belong to a single China, and seeks a closer relationship with the United States. China has reacted by picking off five nations that had diplomatic ties with Taiwan, scaling back Taiwan-bound group tourism and flying military aircraft near the island.\"Looking at the Taiwan election from China's point of view, another term for Tsai would be a disaster,\" said Denny Roy, senior fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu.China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the Chinese civil war, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost and rebased their government in Taiwan. The two sides have been ruled separately for seven decades.", "Hong Kong protesters scuffle with police, government offices shut,REUTERS,June,14,2019": "HONG KONG--Scuffles broke out between demonstrators and police in Hong Kong on Thursday as hundreds of people kept up a protest against a planned extradition law with mainland China, a day after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up big crowds.Protests around the city's legislature on Wednesday forced the postponement of debate on the extradition bill, which many people in Hong Kong fear will undermine freedoms and confidence in the commercial hub.Hong Kong's China-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the violence and urged a swift restoration of order but has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite the reservations about it, including within the business community.The number of protesters milling about outside the legislature in the financial district fell overnight but rose again through the day on Thursday to about 1,000 at one stage.They expect the legislature, which has a majority of pro-Beijing members, will try to hold the debate at some stage, though it issued a notice saying there would be no session on Thursday.\"We will be back when, and if, it comes back for discussion again,\" said protester Stephen Chan, a 20-year-old university student.\"We just want to preserve our energy now.\"Earlier, some protesters tried to stop police from removing their supplies of face masks and food and scuffles broke out.Police with helmets and shields blocked overhead walkways and plainclothes officers checked commuters' identity cards.A clean-up got underway to remove debris like broken umbrellas, helmets, plastic water bottles and barricades from the streets after the previous day's clashes. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray on Wednesday in a series of skirmishes to clear demonstrators from the legislature.Officials said 72 people were admitted to hospitals.Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said what began as a peaceful gathering on Wednesday had degenerated into a riot with protesters \"acting violently in an organized manner.\"Police arrested 11 people and fired about 150 tear gas canisters at the crowd. The city's hospital authority said a total of 81 people were injured in the protests. 22 police were injured according to Lo.Police also later arrested two students at the University of Hong Kong after a raid on a student hall of residence, according to an official at the university. The police gave no immediate response to Reuters inquiries on what charges the students face.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Chinese government \"strongly condemns the violent behavior and we support the (Hong Kong) government in dealing with it according to law.\"In the United States, senior congressional lawmakers from both parties responded to the crisis by introducing legislation that would require the U.S. government to provide an annual justification for the continuation of special business and trade privileges afforded to Hong Kong.\"If the extradition bill moves forward and Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s autonomy and democratic institutions continue to erode due to interference from the Chinese government, the Congress has no choice but to reassess whether Hong Kong can receive preferential economic and trade benefits under U.S. law,\" Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, one of 13 co-sponsors of the proposed legislation, said in a statement.The U.S. State Department said on Monday it was gravely concerned about the proposed amendments to the extradition laws, warning they could jeopardize Hong Kong's special status.Authorities shut government offices in the financial district, which is overlooked by the towers of some of Asia's biggest firms and hotel chains, for the rest of the week after some of the worst violence in Hong Kong in decades.Hong Kong's benchmark stock exchange slid as much as 1.5% on Thursday before closing down 0.1%, extending losses from the previous day.Most roads in the business district were open on Thursday but some shops and offices were closed and banks, including Standard Chartered, Bank of China and DBS, said they had suspended branch services in the area.Wednesday saw the third night of violence since a protest on Sunday drew what organizers said was more than a million people for the biggest street demonstration since the 1997 handover of the former British colony back to Chinese rule.The handover included a deal to preserve special autonomy, but many in Hong Kong accuse China of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms and interference in local elections.The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or travelling through the city, has sparked concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong's international financial status.Beijing rejects accusations of meddling and Chinese state media said this week \"foreign forces\" were trying to damage China by creating chaos over the bill.The English-language China Daily said the \"lawlessness\" would hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its law.Lam and her officials say the law is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said the courts would provide human rights safeguards.The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized Sunday's huge march, said it was planning another demonstration for Sunday.Opponents of the bill, including lawyers and rights groups, say China's justice system is marked by torture and forced confessions and arbitrary detention.Democratic city legislators condemned Lam and what they said was heavy-handed police action.\"We are not a haven for criminals, but we have become a haven of violent police. Firing at our children? None of the former chief executives dared to do that,\" said legislator Fernando Cheung.\"But 'mother Carrie Lam' did it. What kind of mother is she?\"Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not accept any extradition requests from Hong Kong under the proposed law. The self-ruled island also issued a travel alert.Hong Kong's Tourism Board called off a dragon boat carnival this weekend while the city's bar association expressed concern over video footage of police using force against largely unarmed protesters.Amnesty International and domestic rights groups condemned what they said was excessive force by the police, while a spokeswoman for the U.N. Human Rights Office in Geneva said it was following the situation closely.Diplomatic pressure was also building after leaders such as British Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the protests.The European Union said it shared many concerns over the proposed extradition reform and urged public consultation.", "China cyberattack hits messaging app during HK protest,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,13,2019": "BEIJING--An encrypted messaging app said Thursday that it was hit by a powerful cyberattack from China as a major protest unfolded in Hong Kong.The attack on the Telegram app, which slowed connectivity but did not compromise user data, came as thousands surrounded Hong Kong government headquarters on Wednesday to protest legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China to stand trial. They protesters were forcibly dispersed by police using tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that most of the attackers had IP addresses from China.\"Historically, all state actor-sized (attacks) we experienced coincided in time with protests in Hong Kong,\" Durov said. \"This case was not an exception.\"Activists in both Hong Kong and mainland China often use Telegram to organize protests in hopes the encryption will allow them to evade the government surveillance of Chinese social networking apps such as WeChat.Whereas WeChat users reported this week that photos of the protests could not be viewed, apps like Telegram offer more privacy and independence. Telegram is blocked in mainland China, but users can access it using software to circumvent the firewall, which also blocks apps and websites ranging from Facebook to The New York Times.Encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram say that messages sent on their systems cannot be intercepted by third parties during the delivery from sender to recipient. \"We can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression,\" Telegram says on its website.Telegram said that the latest attack was a distributed denial of service in which \"your servers get GADZILLIONS of garbage requests which stop them from processing legitimate requests.\"The messaging app said on Wednesday evening that the system had stabilized.The protest in Hong Kong forced the legislature to cancel its sessions Wednesday and Thursday, putting off debate on the extradition legislation.Opponents say the bill would severely compromise their freedoms and erode Hong Kong's legal independence. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam maintains the legislation is necessary and would have safeguards to ensure human rights are protected.Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, enjoys greater freedoms than mainland China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework put in place when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.

Hong Kong held one of its biggest rallies in recent years to honor the hundreds or possibly thousands of demonstrators killed in the army assault and to demand a full investigation into the crackdown, in what was seen as a further sign of defiance against Beijing.Xi's administration is also dealing with the trade war with the United States that has thrown its export-driven economic model into question, potentially threatening its relationship with China's urban middle class that has been predicated on accepting strict political controls in exchange for improving standards of living. As one of the world's most important financial centers, Hong Kong also stands to suffer from the continuing impasse, adding to frustrations among young people over stagnating salaries and skyrocketing housing prices.Heavy rain Thursday morning kept fresh street protests from following those Wednesday the shut down government headquarters and the Legislative Council on the day it was to debate the extradition bill.

Police warned them back, saying: \"We will use force.\"The protesters, most of them young people dressed in black, had erected barricades as they prepared to hunker down for an extended occupation of the area, in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy \"Occupy\" protests that gridlocked the former British colony in 2014.Protesters rallied in and around Lung Wo Road, a main east-west artery near the offices of embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, as hundreds of armed riot police, some with plastic shields, warned them to stop advancing.\"Didn't we say at the end of the Umbrella movement we would be back?\" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said, referring to the name often used for the \"Occupy\" demonstrations, whose trademark was the yellow umbrella.\"Now we are back!\" she said as supporters echoed her words.Others once again called for Lam to step down.Opposition to the bill on Sunday triggered Hong Kong's biggest political demonstration since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"once country, two systems\" deal guaranteeing it special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary.But many accuse China of extensive meddling since, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with local elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.Lam has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite deep concerns in the Asian financial hub, including among business leaders, that it could undermine those freedoms and investor confidence and erode the city's competitive advantages.The government said debate on the bill that was due to take place in the city's 70-seat Legislative Council on Wednesday would be delayed until further notice.The legislature is controlled by a pro-Beijing majority.\"We won't leave till they scrap the law,\" said one young man wearing a black mask and gloves.\"Carrie Lam has underestimated us. We won't let her get away with this.\"Beijing again reiterated that the \"one country, two systems\" formula was best for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability.\"The practice of 'one country, two systems' in Hong Kong has achieved remarkable success. This is an undeniable objective fact,\" Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman An Fengshan told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Many of the protesters, who skipped work, school or university to join the rally, defied police calls to retreat and passed around provisions, including medical supplies, goggles, water and food.Some stockpiled bricks broken away from pavements.Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung urged the protesters to stop occupying the road and appealed for calm and restraint. \"We also appeal to the people who are stationed to ... disperse as soon as possible, and not to try to defy/challenge the law,\" he said.The demonstrators rallied just a stone's throw from the heart of the financial center, where glittering skyscrapers house the offices of some of the world's biggest companies, including HSBC.The massive rally was also within sight of the Hong Kong garrison of China's People's Liberation Army, whose presence in the city has been one of the most sensitive elements of the 1997 handover.Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia and HSBC suspended bank operations at some branches in the area.A spokesman for bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said Lam would not attend a cocktail reception on Wednesday as previously planned.The proposed bill has attracted widespread criticism at home and abroad, prompting rare criticism from judges, Hong Kong's business community, some pro-establishment figures and several foreign governments and business chambers.Demonstrators began joining overnight protests earlier on Wednesday as businesses across the city prepared to go on strike.Lam has sought to soothe public concerns and said her administration was creating additional amendments to the bill, including safeguarding human rights.Under the proposed law, Hong Kong residents, as well as foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, would all be at risk if they were wanted on the mainland.Sunday's protest, which organizers said saw more than a million people take to the streets, in addition to a growing backlash against the extradition bill, could raise questions about Lam's ability to govern effectively.The protests have plunged Hong Kong into political crisis, just as the 2014 demonstrations did, heaping pressure on Lam's administration and her official backers in Beijing.The failure of the 2014 protests to wrest concessions on democracy from Beijing, coupled with the prosecutions of at least 100 mostly young protesters, initially discouraged many from returning to the streets. That changed on Sunday.The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong called on the government not to pass the bill \"hurriedly\" and urged Christians to pray for the city. Lam, who warned against \"radical action\" at the protests, is a Catholic.Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, as reasons why the Hong Kong bill should not proceed.China denies accusations that it tramples on human rights and official media said this week \"foreign forces\" were trying to damage China by creating chaos over the extradition bill.", "New Zealand court stops man from being extradited to China,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,12,2019": "WELLINGTON--A New Zealand court on Tuesday stopped a man accused of killing a woman in Shanghai a decade ago from being extradited to China, at least for now, due to concerns he could be tortured.The long-running case represents the first time China has attempted to extradite a suspect from New Zealand, and the Court of Appeal said the issues in the case were difficult. It concluded torture is illegal in China but remains widespread in its criminal justice system.The court ruled New Zealand Justice Minister Andrew Little must reconsider whether Kyung Yup Kim should be extradited to China, where he faces one count of intentional homicide.The ruling comes at a time that Hong Kong is considering a bill that would allow suspects in the semi-autonomous territory to be extradited to mainland China. The proposal has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets in the largest protests there in at least a decade.Critics believe the legislation would risk Hong Kong residents, who were promised they could maintain greater freedoms after the former British colony's handover to China in 1997, being entrapped in China's opaque judicial system.New Zealand doesn't have a formal extradition agreement with China and the case is considered an important precedent.According to court documents, Kim is a Korean citizen who moved to New Zealand 30 years ago with his family when he was aged 14. He is accused of killing a 20-year-old woman, Pei Yun Chen, in Shanghai in 2009. Chinese police say they have forensic and circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.Kim claims he has a defense to the charge but won't get a fair trial in China.Kim was arrested in 2011 and spent five years in New Zealand jails as his extradition case proceeded before he was released on bail.In its judgment, the court found that China conceals torture so it's hard to monitor and that there are substantial disincentives for anybody who is detained there to report torture. It said that there is a cultural shift away from torture in China.\"Nevertheless, torture remains widespread and confessions obtained through torture are regularly admitted in evidence,\" the court found in its 99-page judgment.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday that Beijing attaches \"great importance to the protection and promotion of human rights.\"\"The Chinese judicial system effectively guarantees various legal rights of the criminal suspects, and the achievements we have made in terms of human rights protection in the judicial field are there for all to see,\" he said at a regular news briefing.He said it was important to \"uphold justice for the victims.\"\"We hope that New Zealand can handle it in a fair manner and extradite Kim back to China as soon as possible,\" Geng said.", "Hong Kong delays bill debate as protest crowds block entry,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong delayed a legislative session on a contentious extradition bill as thousands of protesters amassed to block entry to the building Wednesday out of concern the measure signaled greater Chinese control and further erosion of civil liberties in the semiautonomous territory.The overwhelmingly young crowd of demonstrators filled nearby streets, overturned barriers and tussled with police outside the government headquarters and offices of the Legislative Council.A statement from the government's press service said the session of the Hong Kong's Legislative Council that was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. would be \"changed to a later time to be determined\" by the council secretariat. Council members would be notified of the time of the meeting later, the statement said.A protester who gave only his first name, Marco, said he hoped the action would persuade Chief Executive Carrie Lam's administration to shelve the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.\"We want the government to just set the legislation aside and not bring it back,\" he said.A fellow protester who gave her name as King said the protest was a watershed moment for Hong Kong's young generation, who face difficult job prospects and skyrocketing housing prices.\"We have to stand up for our rights or they will be taken away,\" she said.The reluctance of protesters to be identified by their full names and professions--many wore surgical masks to obscure their facial features--reflected an increasingly hard-line approach to civil unrest by the authorities. Such actions are never tolerated in mainland China, and Hong Kong residents can face travel bans and other repercussions if they cross the border.Another statement from the government's information office said access roads leading to the Central Government Offices were blocked and police has implemented traffic arrangements.Staff members were advised not to go to into work and those already on the premises were told to \"stay at their working place until further notice.\"Under its \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong was supposed to be guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British rule in 1997. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.The government pushed ahead with plans to present the amendments to the legislature on Wednesday despite a weekend protest by hundreds of thousands of people that was the territory's largest political demonstration in more than a decade. A crowd began gathering outside the Legislative Council on Tuesday night, and U.S. Consulate is warning people to avoid the area, exercise caution and keep a low profile. Some businesses closed for the day, and labor strikes and class boycotts were also called.The legislation has become a lightning rod for concerns about Beijing's increasing control over the semiautonomous territory.Lam has consistently defended the legislation as necessary to close legal loopholes with other countries and territories. A vote was scheduled on June 20.Sunday's protest was widely seen as reflecting growing apprehension about relations with the Communist Party-ruled mainland, whose leader, Xi Jinping, has said he has zero tolerance for those demanding greater self-rule for Hong Kong.Critics believe the extradition legislation would put Hong Kong residents at risk of being entrapped in China's judicial system, in which opponents of Communist Party rule have been charged with economic crimes or ill-defined national security offenses, and would not be guaranteed free trials.Lam, who canceled her regular question and answer session on Wednesday, said the government has considered concerns from the private sector and altered the bill to improve human rights safeguards. She said without the changes, Hong Kong would risk becoming a haven for fugitives.She emphasized that extradition cases would be decided by Hong Kong courts.Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a lawyer and member of Lam's administration advisory committee, said Sunday's protest showed a lack of trust in Hong Kong's administration, partly because Lam was selected by a small number of electors rather than by popular vote. However, China's patience with Hong Kong's demands has its limits, Tong said.\"We need to gain the trust and confidence of Beijing so they can allow us the freedom of political reform,\" Tong said. \"They don't want to see Hong Kong as a base of subversion. And I'm sorry, we're doing exactly that.\"Opponents of the proposed extradition amendments say the changes would significantly compromise Hong Kong's legal independence, long viewed as one of the crucial differences between the territory and mainland China.Hong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing agreements and to others on an individual basis. China has been excluded from those agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record.The mainland's ruling Communist Party exerts influence on the Hong Kong government. Lam was elected in 2017 by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites and was widely seen as the Communist Party's favored candidate.The Legislative Council includes a sizable camp of pro-Beijing lawmakers.Those in Hong Kong who anger China's central government have come under greater pressure since Xi came to power in 2012.The detention of several Hong Kong booksellers in late 2015 intensified worries about the erosion of Hong Kong's rule of law. The booksellers vanished before resurfacing in police custody in mainland China. Among them, Swedish citizen Gui Minhai is currently being investigated on charges of leaking state secrets after he sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders.In April, nine leaders of a 2014 pro-democracy protest movement known as the \"Umbrella Revolution\" were convicted on public nuisance and other charges.In May, Germany confirmed it had granted asylum to two people from Hong Kong who, according to media reports, were activists fleeing tightening restrictions at home. It was the first known case in recent years of a Western government accepting political refugees from Hong Kong.", "Hong Kong pushes bill allowing extraditions to China despite biggest protest since handover,REUTERS,June,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vowed on Monday to push ahead with amendments to laws allowing suspects to be extradited to mainland China, a day after the city's biggest protest since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Riot police ringed Hong Kong's legislature and fought back a group of several hundred protesters who stayed behind early on Monday after Sunday's peaceful march that organizers said drew more than a million people, or one in seven of the city's people.\"I don't think it is (an) appropriate decision for us now to pull out of this bill because of the very important objectives that this bill is intended to achieve,\" a somber Lam told reporters while flanked by security and justice chiefs.\"While we will continue to do the communication and explanation, there is very little merit to be gained to delay the bill.

Areas of special treatment include visas, law enforcement, including extraditions, and investment.A U.S. congressional commission said in a report last month that amending the extradition laws could provide grounds for Washington to re-examine elements of its relationship with Hong Kong outlined in the 1992 law.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China under a \"one-country, two-systems\" formula, with guarantees that its autonomy and freedoms, including an independent justice system, would be protected.But many accuse China of extensive meddling in many sectors, denying democratic reforms and squeezing freedoms, interfering with local elections and the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.

This bill is not initiated by the central people's government. I have not received any instruction or mandate from Beijing to do this bill,\" she told reporters.She said the bill would be put for debate on Wednesday as planned in the city's 70-seat Legislative Council, which is now controlled by a pro-Beijing majority.Lam and her officials stress the need for haste to prosecute a young Hong Kong man suspected of killing his girlfriend in Taiwan.

It appeared to be even bigger than a massive pro-democracy demonstration in 2003 against a proposed national security law, according to Associated Press journalists who covered both events.Late Sunday night, a group of demonstrators broke through barriers at government headquarters, where the march had ended. The crowd briefly pushed its way into the lobby, but police in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to push the protesters outside.

By instituting populist policies, he won the allegiance of many of the country's rural majority and urban poor.His political popularity, however, threatened the influence of the country's traditional ruling circle, including royalists, industrialists and the military, and after protests accusing him of abuse of power, the army ousted him in a 2006 coup.The coup set off a long and sometimes violent struggle for power between Thaksin's supporters and opponents. The courts, one of Thailand's most royalist and conservative institutions, played a major role in fighting comebacks by his political machine with controversial rulings that consistently whittled away at his allies, ultimately forcing three other prime ministers loyal to him to step down.Critics of the courts suggested Thailand came under the sway of a system known as juristocracy or judiocracy, in which the judiciary exercises political power overriding other branches of government, including elected officials.Thailand's decades-old official lottery has been dogged time and again by rigging and corruption scandals.The court's ruling Thursday appeared to claim that the lottery scheme initiated under Thaksin involved unacceptable financial risk to the government.Thai news reports said dozens of other officials were previously tried and convicted for involvement, with some senior figures given suspended prison terms.", "Extradition law is \u00e2\u0080\u0098final nail\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin--activist,REUTERS,June,5,2019": "BERLIN--A Hong Kong independence activist said on Tuesday that proposed amendments to the city's legal system that would allow captured fugitives to be sent to China could deal a fatal blow to the territory's judicial independence.Speaking on the 30th anniversary of China's military crackdown on student-led democracy protests in and around Tiananmen Square, Ray Wong urged democratic countries to up the pressure on the Chinese government to respect human rights.\"This law is the final nail in the coffin,\" Wong, who was granted refugee status in Germany, told Reuters TV in Berlin. \"Because if this law is passed the legal system in Hong Kong will be destroyed. Hong Kong will be just another city in China.\"Calls to the Chinese embassy and Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office in Berlin seeking comment went unanswered.The legal amendments being pushed by the special administrative region's government mark one of the starkest challenges to Hong Kong's legal system and are increasingly troubling its business, political and diplomatic communities.The city's independent legal system was guaranteed under the laws governing Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago and is seen by the financial hub's business and diplomatic communities as its strongest remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing. Hong Kong's extensive autonomy is guaranteed until 2047.Wong spoke to Reuters before a seminar on human rights in China in the Bundestag Lower House on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, which was marked with a somber candlelight vigil in Hong Kong attended by tens of thousands.The proposed changes provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.The amendments allow for the chief executive to both seek the arrest of a fugitive and sign off on their extradition once approved by the courts, including any appeals and judicial reviews.But they also eliminate the oversight roles of the chief executive's Cabinet and the city's legislative body, which can currently step in to evaluate extradition arrangements.Wong is one of two Hong Kong activists facing rioting charges in Hong Kong who have been granted refugee status by Germany. China's Xinhua state news agency on May 25 said Beijing had made \"solemn representations\" to Germany over its decision, demanding Berlin correct its \"mistakes.\"Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has also expressed \"deep regrets and strong objections\" to Germany about the case. Hong Kong authorities deny persecuting activists.Greens parliamentary leader Katrin Goering-Eckardt said German companies doing business in China should become more aware of the country's human rights violations, including the detention of more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in what activists say are mass detention camps.\"German companies are doing business in China very carelessly,\" she said.China has faced growing international condemnation for what it calls re-education and training centers in the remote western region of Xinjiang. Some 5,200 German companies are active in China, employing about 1.1 million people, compared with 900 Chinese companies with branches in Europe's largest economy.\"It is our responsibility to ensure that companies that take part in human rights violations and mass surveillance in China are granted no public contracts in Germany,\" said Goering-Eckardt. \"We must sanction human rights violators.\"", "Dissident artist reveals face on Tiananmen anniversary,REUTERS,June,5,2019": "HONG KONG--One of China's most prominent political cartoonists who has hidden his identity for years to avoid reprisals from the state revealed his face publicly on Tuesday to mark the 30th anniversary of Beijing's June 4 crackdown on Tiananmen protests.Chinese troops brutally crushed the student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square, first opening fire on the night of June 3, 1989, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands, witnesses and rights groups say.Chinese Communist Party rulers have since sought to white-wash the violence, never offering an admission of guilt or wrongdoing or releasing a death toll.Badiucao, a 33-year-old China-born cartoonist and artist who has drawn comparisons to graffiti artist Banksy, said he could no longer remain in the shadows despite threats from China's security apparatus prompted by biting satires that poke fun at Beijing's leaders and their perceived abuse of power.In a documentary on his life called \"China's Artful Dissident\" and shown on ABC television on Tuesday, he shows his face and for the first time details how he was forced to scrap an exhibition in Hong Kong last year given threats against loved ones.\"I'm facing this major choice: to be silent forever, or to fight back, to confront, face to face, this situation,\" the bespectacled cartoonist told Reuters by phone from Melbourne where he lives, still without revealing his name.\"By stepping out on the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre I don't think there's any better time for me to do that.\"Badiucao posts most of his cartoons online and uses social media extensively. When required to appear in public in the past, he sometimes wore a balaclava.Despite his precautions, he said Chinese authorities somehow discovered his identity last year, possibly through digital surveillance while he was planning the Hong Kong show, which would have been his first international exhibition.His works include neon sculptures of deceased Chinese dissident and Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo and a cartoon of Chinese President Xi Jinping holding a rifle next to a dead Winnie the Pooh.Chinese Internet users have in the past likened Pooh's portly appearance to Xi. A small number of people have even used Pooh as a symbol of resistance.Badiucao said he was told by a source that two \"policemen\" from China would show up for the Hong Kong event--stoking fears he might be abducted to mainland China, which took back control of the former British colony in 1997.A Hong Kong-based publisher of books critical of China's leaders was abducted in Thailand in 2015, one of five people in the Hong Kong book trade who went missing that year and later appeared in custody in mainland China.\"Hong Kong is like an egg falling to the ground,\" Badiucao said. \"It might not have impacted the ground but it's already on the way.\"China's main representative \"Liaison Office\" in the city gave no response to a Reuters request for comment.Badiucao took part in Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protests that blocked roads for months in a direct challenge to Beijing, but he says he won't return. He criticized a proposed extradition law that would allow suspects in Hong Kong to be sent back to mainland China for the first time.\"The extradition law is definitely a new trap, allowing mainland China much more power to use its controlling with violence directly in Hong Kong,\" he said. \"It also generates huge fear.\"Last year, he launched a public art project on China's \"Tank Man,\" the nameless individual who stood in front of a row of tanks a day after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in an act of defiance. The man's identity and fate remain unknown.The artist urged people around the world to pose in public as Tank Man, in white shirt, black pants, and holding two bags.\"In order to pass down memory, it's always about the next generation, how to engage them, how to awaken them from this kind of political indifference,\" he said.China's Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a request for comment on the fate of Tank Man. When asked about Tank Man by Reuters at a Foreign Ministry media briefing, spokesman Geng Shuang said: \"I have no understanding of these situations you mention.\"Despite blanket Chinese censorship of June 4, the artist said he would reveal the truth through art.\"The physical body can be crushed or damaged, but the spirit lives for much longer,\" he said. \"I hope within my art and within my action ... will be a way to pass on the spirit of '89.\"", "China handles Tiananmen anniversary with usual silence,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,5,2019": "BEIJING--Dissidents silenced.

References scrubbed from the Internet.China imposed an information lockdown Tuesday on the 30th anniversary of its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, a stark reminder that three decades later, the possibility of democratic change has all but evaporated.Extra checkpoints and street closures greeted tourists who showed up before 5 a.m. to watch the daily flag-raising ceremony at the square in the center of Beijing. People overseas found themselves blocked from posting anything to a popular Chinese social media site.China has largely succeeded in wiping the events of June 3-4, 1989, from the public consciousness at home, where the anniversary of the crackdown passed like any other weekday. To Western critics, who this year included U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, China has a simple answer: Our model works.\"The Chinese government has long had a clear conclusion about the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in response to Pompeo. China's economic success \"fully proves that the development path we chose is completely correct and has been firmly supported by the people.\"The seven-week-long Tiananmen Square protests and their bloody end, in which hundreds if not thousands of people are believed to have died, snuffed out a tentative shift in China toward political liberalization.The mantra of the ruling Communist Party has become stability over all else, and the party says the stability it has delivered has been a necessary underpinning to the country's economic growth.For many Chinese, life is better. Incomes have risen, and social restrictions such as family size and where people can live have been loosened. It's political freedom that remains strictly controlled.Half a dozen activists could not be reached Tuesday by phone or text. One who could, Beijing-based Hu Jia, said he had been taken last week by security agents to the northeastern coastal city of Qinghuangdao.Chinese authorities routinely take dissidents away on what are euphemistically called \"vacations\" or otherwise silence them during sensitive political times.\"This is a reflection of their fears, their terror, not ours,\" Hu said.Under current President Xi Jinping, the government has tightened control over everything from religion to the Internet in an apparent bid to make the Communist Party central to the future of China.\"I don't think that in the foreseeable future there is the possibility for another mass movement against the regime, because the system of control is so complete,\" said Andrew Nathan, a professor of Chinese politics at Columbia University.Chinese overseas reported on Twitter that they were blocked from posting on Weibo, a popular social networking site. Weibo did not respond to phone and email requests for comment.Even those who know what happened 30 years ago are reluctant to talk about it in public. A 24-year-old designer said last week in Beijing that he thought it was quite a pity when he learned that many had died.\"But it's really not convenient to talk about it,\" he said, giving only the name he goes by in English, Tony.Any commemoration of the event is not allowed in mainland China, though tens of thousands turned out for an annual candlelight vigil in Hong Kong. The Chinese territory has relatively greater freedoms than the mainland, though even there, activists are concerned about the erosion of those liberties in recent years.Pompeo issued a statement Monday saluting what he called the \"heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up thirty years ago ... to demand their rights.\" He said that U.S. hopes that China would become a more open and tolerant society have been dashed.He and his European Union counterpart Federica Mogherini urged China to come clean on what happened and how many died.\"Acknowledgement of these events, and of those killed, detained or missing in connection with the Tiananmen Square protests, is important for future generations and for the collective memory,\" Mogherini said in a statement.Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, said that \"some people in the U.S. always regard themselves as others' teachers and interfere in other countries' internal affairs under the guise of so-called democracy and human rights, while turning a blind eye to problems at home. The Chinese people have seen through their hypocrisy and sinister intentions.\"The crackdown set the Communist Party on a path of repression, Nathan said, adding that China would likely be a very different place if the nation's rulers had ended the protests peacefully through dialogue instead of by force.\"They embarked on a strategy of not dialoguing with the people,\" he said. \"The party knows best, the party decides, and the people have no voice. So that requires more and more intense repression of all of the forces in society that want to be heard.\"", "Hong Kong activists hold Tiananmen candlelight vigil,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,5,2019": "HONG KONG--Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong gathered Tuesday night to mark 30 years since China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, underscoring continuing concern for Chinese human rights in the semiautonomous territory, even as its own civil liberties are under threat.Hong Kong is the only region under Beijing's jurisdiction that holds significant public commemorations of the 1989 crackdown and memorials for its victims. Hong Kong has a degree of freedom not seen on the mainland as a legacy of British rule that ended in 1997.The annual vigil at Hong Kong's Victoria Park near the bustling Causeway Bay shopping district appeared to draw tens of thousands of participants who filled several football fields and held candles in the sultry night air. Following an introduction of songs in the city's Cantonese dialect and traditional string music, a minute of silence was held for the Tiananmen crackdown victims.\"By being here, I'm standing for truth and justice, even though I've no hope the Chinese central government will ever do justice to the protesters,\" said participant Stanley Lui, 42.Beijing transplant Jay Jiang, 16, said unlike many on the mainland, she knew about the crackdown even as a young child. The 10th grader was taking part in the Hong Kong vigil for the first time.\"The bottom line is the government should not deceive the people about what happened,\" said Jiang, beads of sweat dotting her cheeks.Estimates of the number of vigil participants varied widely, with police putting the figure at 37,000 and organizers at 180,000.This year's vigil featured a replica of the \"Goddess of Democracy,\" a plaster sculpture of a female figure holding a torch that was displayed in Tiananmen Square in the days leading up to the crackdown, which took place on the night of June 3-4, 1989, and is believed to have killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people.\"That statue was crushed by tanks at the June 4 crackdown, the June 4 massacre. So we are rebuilding this here ... to symbolize that we are still continuing to fight for democracy, and continue on the spirit of the '89 democratic protests,\" said Chow Hang Tung, vice chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which organizes the annual event.Alliance chairman Albert Ho said many participants were seeking to \"demonstrate their commitment to the cause of democracy\" on the 30th anniversary and \"speaking truth to power, especially for those who are silent in the mainland.\"Visitor Winnie Ma, a 55-year-old church worker, said she brought her 80-year-old mother to the park especially to view the statue on the 30th anniversary.\"I don't know if she will see it vindicated, but I hope that I will be able to,\" Ma said.Meanwhile, at the University of Hong Kong, a dozen students laid flower bouquets at the \"Pillar of Shame,\" a sculpture by Danish artist Jens Galschiot commemorating the crackdown's victims.\"Just because I wasn't born then and never experienced the event, there's no stopping me from reminding others like me of this and carrying on the collective memory,\" said 18-year-old student Donald Chung.Students later observed a minute of silence in remembrance of the crackdown's victims before scrubbing the pillar clean in an annual ritual.Recent years have witnessed a generational divide about how best to memorialize the crackdown, and since 2015, Hong Kong university students have arranged their own commemorations separate from the main candlelight vigil.\"People who attend the vigil consider themselves Chinese. We disagree with this identity,\" said Jordan Pang, acting chair of the Hong Kong University Students' Union's current affairs committee.\"I think the young generation and most students consider themselves Hong Kongers. If we need to commemorate, we do not want to use (the vigil) to commemorate,\" Pang said.Despite its pro-democracy theme, young Hong Kongers see the vigil as promoting Chinese nationalism, said Samson Yuen, a professor of political science at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.\"They argue that Hong Kong needs to determine its own future. Hong Kong may need to seek independence from China and they believe that June 4 is a battleground,\" Yuen said.Thirty years ago, the Tiananmen protesters gained widespread support and sympathy from residents of Hong Kong, whose return to Chinese rule had been agreed upon just years earlier. Hong Kong supporters helped sustain the protests with donated funds and equipment and, following the crackdown, mobilized to smuggle wanted student leaders out of the country, sometimes with the assistance of organized crime groups known as triads.The spirit of political activism has now passed to a younger generation, crystalizing in the 2014 Occupy protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, which laid siege to Hong Kong government headquarters and paralyzed the city's financial district for 79 days.The movement fizzled with no concessions from the Hong Kong government for free elections, and the authorities have since cracked down hard on its leaders, sentencing nine in April on public nuisance and other charges.More recently, activists, as well as business and legal associations, have protested amendments making it easier to send criminal suspects in Hong Kong to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.Chinese President Xi Jinping has been seen as extending his crackdown on civil liberties to Hong Kong, threatening the territory's promised semiautonomy.A march against the amendments is scheduled for Sunday ahead of the government's expected push for passage on June 12.The extradition law amendments have put China's chosen Hong Kong leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on the defensive. On Monday, she announced further changes aimed at placating critics.Asked Tuesday whether she agreed with China's justifications for the army crackdown in 1989, Lam did not answer directly, but said Hong Kong was a \"very free society\" that upholds the rights and freedoms of individuals.\"So today, if there are public gatherings to express their views and feelings on a particular historic incident, we fully respect those views,\" Lam said.Along with concerns over the amended extradition law, Lam's administration has faced accusations that it was abusing public order statutes to intimidate potential protesters. That prompted Germany last year to grant political asylum to two Hong Kong dissidents, Ray Wong Toi Yeung and fellow pro-democracy protester Alan Li Tung Sing.In an opinion essay in Tuesday's New York Times, Wong said that \"the situation is dire\" in Hong Kong. \"The Chinese government keeps repressing, but people keep resisting,\" he wrote.Wong was to speak at a seminar marking the Tiananmen crackdown hosted by the Germany's opposition Greens party.Meanwhile in Taiwan, hundreds of people gathered in the self-governing island's capital, Taipei, on Tuesday to mark the Tiananmen anniversary. The crowd was addressed by activists and Taiwan's vice president.Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, took to Facebook to highlight the contrast between her democratically elected government and China's authoritarian communist system.Tsai said China had shown that it not only had no intention of reflecting on \"that year's mistake\" but also planned to continue covering up the truth about the 1989 crackdown.She cited comments Sunday by China's defense minister at a forum in Singapore defending the army's bloody assault on protesters and Beijing citizens, as well as Hong Kong's refusal to allow entry to former student leader Feng Congde.\"Please rest easy, Taiwan will absolutely adhere to democracy, adhere to freedom, regardless of threats or infiltration. As long as I am president for just one day, there is no way Taiwan will yield to pressure,\" Tsai wrote.China considers Taiwan its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary. Beijing has proposed ruling Taiwan under the same \"one country, two systems\" formula applied to Hong Kong, something the islands voters have overwhelmingly rejected.", "Tiananmen vets look back on movement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistakes, passion,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,31,2019": "BEIJING--Wu'er Kaixi was among the most outspoken of the student leaders during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, famously reproaching then-Premier Li Peng at a meeting broadcast on national television.Three decades on, he's more circumspect but remains just as harsh a critic of the Communist regime and just as committed to bringing democracy to China.While many former leaders and participants in the protests have moved on, embracing lives and careers that have little direct relation to the movement, others remain wedded to the cause, either by vocation, through survivors' guilt or because their actions permanently put them on the wrong side of the authorities. They remain determined to keep the memories alive even as China's rulers seek to sandblast the protests and the military's bloody crackdown from history.\"Sometimes remembrance is one of the most humble forms of resistance,\" Wu'er Kaixi said in an interview in Taiwan, where he now lives with his wife and children.While Wu'er Kaixi, 51, escaped abroad after the June 4 crackdown after finding himself at No. 2 on the government's most-wanted list, then-graduate student Pu Zhiqiang remained in China despite his role in the protests as a high-profile advocate of speech and press freedoms. Looking at old photos of his younger self, Pu reflects on the motivations of the protesters that were mostly pure, if somewhat naive.\"We hoped that China could change for the better,\" said Pu, 54. \"As a 24-year-old, presented with this chance to serve society, had I not played a role at all, not made my voice heard, I would not have been able to forgive myself.\"While many who took part wonder what could have been done differently to avoid the bloodshed, Feng Congde, a graduate student that year at elite Peking University, is convinced the students didn't push hard enough.The experience of 1989 was \"both positive and negative,\" Feng said. \"But we have to learn the lesson, that even though we had these large numbers of people on the street, we didn't know what we should do. We should have asked the military to overthrow the regime.\"Feng maintains that now, as back then, the regime remains resistant to reforming itself in the way that Taiwan's Nationalists evolved from an authoritarian police state into a multiparty democracy, eventually handing over power to the opposition through elections. Like many in the democratic movement, Feng idolizes Chiang Ching-kuo, the son and successor of Chiang Kai-shek, who began the process of Taiwan's democratization during the 1980s.\"I'm quite optimistic about the democratic future of China, but I have very little hope that (President and Communist Party leader) Xi Jinping can learn from Chiang Ching-kuo. I think the totalitarian (Communist Party) regime is totally different from an authoritarian regime like the (Nationalists),\" Feng said.While few echo Feng's ruing of the lost chance of a military coup, hostility toward the regime and frustration with perceived foreign gullibility are near constants among members of the movement who remain active, especially those based abroad. Their impressions appear permanently colored by the shock, horror and disbelief they felt when the People's Liberation Army opened fire on the people they'd been charged with protecting and who'd grown to trust and revere them.Wang Dan, 50, who was imprisoned after being named No. 1 on the most-wanted list, is among those who doesn't mince words.\"It is time for us now, for the whole democratic countries now, to re-recognize the true face of the (Communist Party) and try to learn some lessons from the Tiananmen massacre,\" Wang said, using another term for the crackdown of June 3-4. \"This is a very important challenge for the whole world, because now China is a rising power, and seems like a threat for the democracy and freedom of the whole world.\"Wu'er Kaixi is similarly scathing, deriding the regime's claims to patriotic zeal as a cover for their desire to maintain their wealth and privileges at any cost.\"Let's look at what the Chinese regime is clearly. It's a group of people who stole the position of ruling China, one of the largest counties in the world and they're taking advantage of that position to do one thing: loot,\" he said.Pu, a lawyer who was disbarred for his political activism, bemoans 1989 and the years since as a lost opportunity to develop a new, possibly alternative, political class.Tiananmen \"was an excellent training opportunity for taking part in society, taking part in politics for young people of my generation,\" Pu said. \"But the distinctive characteristic of Chinese politics--this long-term totalitarianism--is that it cannot permit a political force or political party to take organized action.\"Things have grown only more difficult amid tightening social controls, making it much harder to rally forces in society to do things \"either good or bad,\" Pu said.Yet Wu'er Kaixi, now the honorary chairman of Reporters Without Borders at its East Asia office in Taipei, says those actions--the increasing repression borne out in policies such as the internment of 1 million or more Chinese Muslims in re-education camps--provide a constant reminder of the unchanged nature of the regime.\"The reason people still remember (1989), other than the mere importance of it, is also because the Communist Party is still conducting all of these brutal acts and atrocities within China against Uighur people, against Tibetans, Hong Kong, Macau, and even conducting threats against neighboring countries like Taiwan,\" he said.\"That will remind people that this regime, today's acts of this regime, is the same regime that massacred peaceful demonstrators 30 years ago,\" he said.Feng, who is studying acupuncture and administers pro-democracy websites, and Wu'er Kaixi say their continued zeal for the cause is bolstered by a sense of obligation to those who fell in 1989, to see their names rehabilitated and their goal of a democratic China achieve fruition.\"So I have to live with this survivor's guilt ... but I will try to make the dream of those who fell 30 years ago come true sooner,\" Wu'er Kaixi said.Pu, who continues to work as a legal adviser, said he sees his generation as a link to the past. Veterans, those around 50, are now the \"backbone of society\" who are obligated to pass on their experiences and ideals to a younger generation.Apart from the leaders, who to varying degrees have had some say in how they have lived their lives since, Tiananmen left many scarred for life or saddled with criminal records that have severely restricted their choices.Since serving a 17-year sentence for allegedly attacking martial law troops--a charge he denies--Dong Shengkun has been unable to find a steady job and is forced to live with his elderly mother while receiving the government's minimum living allowance of 1,000 yuan ($145) per month. Though he wishes to marry his girlfriend, the government would take away even that meager stipend were he to do so due to her somewhat better financial circumstances.Still, Dong, who picks up odd jobs for extra income, has no regrets for having joined in the protests out of a sense of outrage and desire for change.The 1989 movement \"was about justice,\" Dong said.", "Philippines ships 69 containers of garbage back to Canada,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,31,2019": "SUBIC, Philippines--The Philippines, one of two Southeast Asian countries that protested being treated like dumpsites by wealthier nations, on Friday shipped 69 containers of what its officials called illegally transported garbage back to Canada.Administrator Wilma Eisma of Subic Bay freeport said the tons of garbage were loaded overnight on the container ship M/V Bavaria, which left on a 20-day journey to the Canadian port city of Vancouver and ended a \"sordid chapter in our history.\" The Bavaria will stop at a Taiwanese port before heading to Canada, she said.Environmental activists, including those from Greenpeace and EcoWaste Coalition, welcomed the Bavaria's arrival at Subic Bay, and on Thursday sailed on board a small outrigger with a streamer reading, \"Philippines: not a garbage dumping ground!\"President Rodrigo Duterte had threatened to forcibly ship back the trash, which officials said was transported to the Philippines in 103 containers in 2013 to 2014, and falsely declared as recyclable plastic scraps. Several containers of the trash had been disposed of, including in a landfill, leaving 69 containers of electrical and household waste, including used diapers, rotting in two Philippine ports.The Philippine government recalled its ambassador and consuls in Canada earlier this month over Ottawa's failure to comply with a May 15 deadline to take back the waste.\"I think the message that we're sending to the world is that we will not be a pushover and, moreover, that the president is really somebody to reckon with,\" Eisma told The Associated Press.The return of the garbage removes a six-year thorn in relations between the two countries, especially under Duterte, a temperamental leader who took office in mid-2016. He has resented international criticism, including by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of his bloody crackdown on illegal drugs that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.The countries had sought to resolve the problem for years, with Trudeau saying in 2017 that legal issues preventing the return of the garbage had been resolved.The return, however, was delayed by other issues despite Canadian assurances of its willingness to take back the garbage that Trudeau said was shipped to Manila in a private commercial transaction.Last week, Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the government had awarded a contract to French shipping giant Bollore Logistics Canada, calling for the return of the containers by the end of June.But presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo rejected the plan, saying the Duterte administration would look for a private shipping company to transport the garbage sooner.\"If Canada will not accept their trash, we will leave the same within its territorial waters,\" Panelo said. \"The president's stance is as principled as it is uncompromising: The Philippines as an independent sovereign nation must not be treated as trash by other foreign nations.\"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has also criticized the practice of wealthier countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan sending their non-recyclable waste to poorer countries.Speaking in Tokyo on Thursday, Mahathir said it was \"grossly unfair\" and should stop. His comments came a few days after his government announced plans to return thousands of tons of plastic waste to mostly Western countries.China banned the import of plastic waste last year, causing other Southeast Asian nations to become new destinations.Philippine environmental groups urged the Duterte administration on Thursday to ban all imports of waste and ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, which prohibits the import of waste for any reason, including recycling. They cited the discovery of other waste shipments to the Philippines from South Korea in 2018 and more recently from Australia and Hong Kong.The garbage issue has been the latest strain in Philippine relations with Canada under Duterte. Last year, he canceled a multimillion-dollar agreement to buy 16 helicopters from Canada after Trudeau's government decided to review the deal due to concerns that the Philippine military might use the aircraft in counterinsurgency assaults.", "Thousands in Hong Kong commemorate 1989 Tiananmen protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,27,2019": "HONG KONG--More than 2,000 people marched in Hong Kong on Sunday to mark 30 years since a pro-democracy protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square ended in bloodshed.Demonstrators took to the streets holding yellow umbrellas that read \"Support Freedom, Oppose Evil Laws.\" Some people carried a black coffin, while others wheeled white crosses and the numbers 6 and 4--a nod to the day on June 4, 1989, when leaders of China's ruling Communist Party ordered the military to re-take Tiananmen Square from student-led protesters.Hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters and onlookers were killed late on June 3 and in the early hours of June 4 as a result of the martial action.Commemorations of the historic event are strictly banned in mainland China, and those who attempt to raise awareness of or merely discuss it are often punished by authorities. Groups such as the \"Tiananmen Mothers\" are pressured to stay quiet about the children they lost, while others are detained for making even subtle tributes to the occasion.The semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong, however, holds yearly vigils and other gatherings to remember the deceased and pay tribute to the spirit of the protests.This year in Hong Kong, the march took on additional significance as opposition to changes to an extradition law widely seen as eroding the territory's independent legal system.Revisions to the law would make it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where critics say they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.\"Recently, we are facing the challenge of this (extradition law), which affects our basic freedom and liberty,\" said Albert Ho, who organized Sunday's march. He is chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China.\"The dedication and the commitment to fight for democracy and human rights is the only way out,\" said Ho, who added that he hopes more people will become aware of the situation facing Hong Kong as legislators debate the proposed amendments.", "Hong Kong leader presses on with extradition bill called \u00e2\u0080\u0098evil\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,May,21,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's leader said on Tuesday that her administration was determined to push through an extradition bill that could see individuals sent back to mainland China for trial, despite mounting opposition locally and internationally.The proposed legislation has stoked mass protests in the former British colony, which was promised a high degree of autonomy under a \"one country, two systems\" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.On Monday, the government said it would bypass legislative procedure to expedite the passage of amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which the U.S. State Department last week described as threatening the rule of law in Hong Kong.Opponents had disrupted a succession of legislative sessions meant to scrutinize the bill, with brawls breaking out in the legislative council.\"Valuable time for deliberation has been lost,\" Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters.\"The most serious issue is that we couldn't see a way forward, how to break this deadlock other than to force me to scrap this bill, but this is unrealistic,\" she told reporters.She said the bill would now be sent directly to the full legislature on June 12 for a second reading, to try to pass it before the legislature's summer recess.If the bill is passed, Hong Kong would allow, for the first time, ad hoc extradition requests to countries with no existing extradition treaties, including places like Taiwan, and crucially, mainland China.Taiwan has said the bill would extend China's reach into Hong Kong, putting at risk any Taiwanese who pass through the city.The Hong Kong government insists the extradition law has safeguards to protect human rights, including the need for all extradition requests to be approved by a local court.During the past week, Beijing has hardened its stance, with senior officials saying the law was urgently needed, though Lam said the initial push for the law had come from her government.Criticism has also poured in from the business, legal, media and diplomatic communities in Hong Kong.More large protests are expected, including on June 4, when the city hosts an annual candlelight vigil for victims of a bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.Lam Cheuk-ting, an opposition Democratic Party lawmaker, criticized the government's move to fast-track the \"evil law.\"Lawmakers may still be able to propose amendments to the bill, but critics say the government can choose not to adopt them, given backing from a pro-Beijing majority in the legislature.Pro-democracy media magnate Jimmy Lai, who runs Hong Kong's tabloid Apple Daily newspaper, said in a talk at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club that the law's implications were grave.\"In one swoop it finishes Hong Kong. It's a massacre of our freedom, of our legal system, of the free press. Everything,\" Lai said.", "Hong Kong court sends protest leader back to jail as \u00e2\u0080\u0098deterrent\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,May,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's Court of Appeal sent a young leader of the Chinese-ruled city's 2014 \"Umbrella\" pro-democracy street protests back to jail on Thursday for contempt of court, ruling out any motive other than ensuring a \"deterrent sentence.\"Joshua Wong, 22, was sentenced to three months in jail in January last year for disobeying a court order and not leaving a protest zone during the rallies that blocked major roads in the Chinese-ruled city for nearly three months.The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction but reduced his jail sentence to two months, citing his young age as a reason. He had earlier served six days before being released pending the appeal.Wong, then just 17, was at the forefront of the broad civil disobedience movement that presented China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Communist Party rulers in Beijing with one of their biggest political challenges in decades, accused by many of interference in Hong Kong's affairs.\"It is an affront to the court and must be met with a deterrent sentence,\" the three judges said in a written summary.\"Any suggestion that he is punished because of his status or notoriety as a committed social activist or any other reason, whatever it might be, is entirely baseless and misconceived.\"As guards led Wong away, he shouted: \"Everyone keep going!\" Dozens of supporters in the public gallery cheered back in response.Dozens more had gathered outside the court building, some waving yellow umbrellas--the symbol of the 2014 protests.Both Wong and his supporters also called for the scrapping of Hong Kong government proposals to remove long-standing blocks on extraditing wanted suspects from Hong Kong to countries with which the city has no extradition agreements--including mainland China.\"Even though they can lock up our bodies, they can't lock up our minds,\" Wong said as he entered court to hear the verdict.Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech, but critics accuse Beijing of increasing pressure on the freewheeling global financial hub.Wong's sentence comes as concerns widen over the extradition amendments, uniting some opposition, business and legal groups as well as Western governments.More street protests are expected in coming weeks, with some seeing the extradition plans as the latest sign of Beijing's interference. China's main representative \"Liaison Office\" in Hong Kong said in a statement on Wednesday that the extradition law was urgently needed and had a sound legal foundation.In a related case in February last year, Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest court freed Wong and two other leaders in a stark reversal of an earlier jail sentence, but warned against future acts of dissent.", "Chaotic scenes at Hong Kong legislature over extradition law,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's legislative assembly descended into chaos Saturday as lawmakers for and against controversial amendments to the territory's extradition law clashed over access to the chamber.At least one person was taken from the chamber on a gurney following the morning melee, in which legislators grappled with each other on the floor and amid seats and tables.The amendments have been widely criticized as eroding the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's legal independence by making it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.Under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong was guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.The amendments expand the scope for the transfer of criminal suspects to China and remove the legislature's right to scrutinize individual extradition decisions filed by Hong Kong's chief executive.They could also open the way for further measures to erode Hong Kong's civil liberties, including the passage of anti-subversion legislation that has been strongly opposed by many.Saturday's legislative scuffle came weeks after a Hong Kong court handed down prison sentences of up to 16 months to eight leaders of massive 2014 pro-democracy protests on public nuisance charges. The harsh sentences were seen as an effort by the Hong Kong government to draw a line under the protests amid pressure from Beijing.Tens of thousands of people marched against the extradition law amendments in Hong Kong last month and numerous legal, professional and human rights organizations have voiced their opposition. They warn the amendments would undermine not just Hong Kong's legal independence but also its attractiveness as a center for international business.Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said Friday the government would \"further explain the proposed fugitive law change to the public,\" according to the government's press office.\"Some citizens and overseas organizations might have misunderstandings about the proposed law amendments,\" Cheung said.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said the amendments must be passed to close a \"loophole\" under which the government has been unable to extradite a Hong Kong man, Chan Tong-kai, accused of killing his girlfriend in Taiwan last year. Lam was chosen in 2017 from among a slate of candidates approved by Beijing and elected by a 1,200-member pro-China electoral body.However, self-governing Taiwan has firmly ruled out signing any extradition agreement with Hong Kong unless it is treated as an equal, a condition Beijing, which claims the island as its own territory, is certain to reject. That would appear to undermine one of the government's major justifications for the amendments.Taiwanese officials have also warned that Taiwanese detained in Hong Kong could be sent to China for their political activities if the amendments are passed. A Taiwanese activist, Lee Ming-che, is currently serving a five-year sentence in China after being convicted by a Chinese court in November 2017 on charges of subverting state power for holding online political lectures and helping the families of jailed Chinese dissidents.Lee disappeared into the custody of the security services in March 2017 after crossing into China from Macau to meet with a friend. His arrest was seen as a sign the ruling party intends to extend its intolerance of criticism even outside its borders.The Hong Kong government will continue to liaise with Taiwan over the homicide case, Cheung said.", "Thousands march on May Day, demand better working conditions,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,2,2019": "SEOUL--Thousands of trade union members and activists were marking May Day on Wednesday by marching through Asia's capitals and demanding better working conditions and expanding labor rights.A major South Korean umbrella trade union also issued a joint statement with a North Korean workers' organization calling for the Koreas to push ahead with engagement commitments made during a series of inter-Korean summits last year. Many of the plans agreed to between the Koreas, including joint economic projects, have been held back by a lack of progress in nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang.May Day rallies were also being held in other parts of Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Cambodia and Myanmar. Other parts of the world were set to have rallies as well.In Sri Lanka, major political parties called off traditional May Day rallies due to security concerns following the Easter bombings that killed 253 people and were claimed by militants linked to the Islamic State group.French authorities announced tight security measures for May Day demonstrations, with the interior minister saying there was a risk that \"radical activists\" could join anti-government yellow vest protesters and union workers in the streets of Paris and across the country.

South Korean laws ban government employees and laid-off workers from forming or joining labor unions.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which organized the protests and issued the joint statement with the North Korean organization, said more than 27,000 demonstrators turned out for Wednesday's marches in Seoul.

Construction workers called for legislation to ensure work safety, while freelance workers are seeking basic labor protections such as the right to recover unpaid wages.Thousands of low-paid workers took to the streets in Indonesia to demand higher wages, better benefits and improved working conditions in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
