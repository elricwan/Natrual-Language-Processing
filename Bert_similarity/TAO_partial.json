That was main pass to tables further down. The distance between bar and my sit was about 2 feet. Every single person who was passing could not avoid pushing my chair or touching my head. Busboy touched by head with the basket of clean wet classes that he was caring (I am sure unintentionally, just no space to be more in control of what he was caring).

She raved about this place, and so we were so excited to come here. Made reservations for 11 p.m. (Tao even called us in the morning to confirm our reservation). Arrived on time. At 11:30 p.m., we still weren\u2019t seated. They informed us that they were still seating their 10:30 p.m. reservations and that they couldn\u2019t guarantee how much longer we would have to wait. Given that we did not yet eat dinner and it could be another 30-45 min, we decided to cancel our reservation. The host was super nice and gave us vouchers for complimentary drinks at the bar. She also said we could sit anywhere in the lounge if there was a free seat. We waited for the bartender (male with glasses) to serve us. He didn\u2019t serve us, asked for our IDs but then proceeded to serve other people. He didn\u2019t bother to wait and was extremely rude. No hospitality whatsoever. The fact that we patiently waited for him, quickly got out our IDs, but then had to wait again while he served other patrons... That was pretty despicable service. On top of that, the lounge was packed and bouncers/security just kept on telling people where to stand. And we just always felt like we were in people\u2019s way. Treated like herds of cattle. When some seats opened up, we went to go sit down (we have been standing for an hour now), but one of the servers kicked us out. When other patrons went to sit in those same seats, they did not get kicked out. Quite the double standard in service. Our New York experience has been completely ruined by Tao\u2019s lack hospitality and basic customer service. Their only saving grace was their hostess (Alexa?). We will never be returning to this chain. I can guarantee you that other patrons would never be treated like this in Toronto. I think we\u2019ll stick to our side of the border. Thanks for single-handedly ruining our trip, Tao. It is now 12:30 a.m., and we are headed to Brooklyn for better service.

It's really fancy place, people are nicely dressed.  The decor is beautiful, modern and very warm. We got a table in the lounge, which was cool to be upstairs overlooking the main floor and ordered from  full menu which is great! What we did not like. The coconut shrimp is too heavily breaded with regular flower dough which has nothing to do with the coconut shrimp, yes shaved or shredded coconut on the side was the coconut portion. The problem with that was that coconut was sweetened which is all wrong, especially for people who don't do sugar. Abundance of white flower and sweet coconut made this dish uneatable for us. Light tempura breading and unsweetened coconut would have been much better choice  and would allow to taste the shrimp.  And second,  is that one of the candles fell on my very expensive scarf and the sweater covering it with wax! I told the waitress and she suggested to iron it which made matters only worse. in classy restaurant I expect them to take care of a mishap like that or at least reduce the bill by amount of dry cleaning. Of course having candles is quite romantic, but at lease secure them enough so they don't fall on customers.

It was bad from the first moment. The woman seating us was snarly. Then they had told us they seat until 11.45pm no problem, but when we got there (11.36 by the way) they rushed us through the meal. Food was pretty much blah. I even commented that PF Changs is better. For real. I will give ecredit to the waitress though, she was on top of it. And I do love the decor. Well, and it's cool for people watching. But the food is mediocre at best. We had Mongolian beef... or rather, my dog is going to have Mongolian beef later tonight. It was a 3 out of 10. Chicken satay was ok. Salmon tartare was boring. The waitress did try to steer us away from that, in fairness. 8 green rice was ok.

I was in awe as soon as we entered, however that quickly went away when it came time for us to eat. We sat on the seats they had that were in the middle of the staircase. As soon as our waitress came I felt this awful negative vibe from her. She acted extremely pretentious and to make it worse gave me the NASTIEST attitude for asking questions about the menu. She even talked down at me as if I was a child. I was seriously contemplating getting up and leaving but I refused to let her ruin my special night with my sweet man. Now the food is what led me to give the extra star in the review. I had the Temple Salad, Mongolian Beef, and Warm Chocolate Cake. The Mongolian Beef TRULY was the showstopper for me. The flavors were incredible and the meat melted in my mouth. My mouth is watering as I write this. Yes, it's that good. My boyfriend got the Vegetable Spring Roll, Chicken Pad Thai, and the Fruit with Sorbet. He enjoyed his meal as well. Overall the food left me feeling on top of the world, but remembering the service I experienced brought me back to reality, left too much of a bad taste in my mouth, and unfortunately outweighed the beauty of the food and decor.

Tao was completely unprofessional and I'll explain why in detail. Around noon, I had made a reservation over the phone to dine at Tao at 9pm that same evening. I arrived 15 minutes early and confirmed my 9pm reservation with the reception. They never called me for my table. I checked in with them 15 minutes after my reservation time, at which point the table was not ready.  I checked in after another 15 minutes, and my table still wasn't ready. When I told the receptionist that I had a 9pm reservation and I had been waiting for half an hour, she blew me off saying my table would be ready soon; she then proceeded to speak with two other parties despite the fact that I was speaking with her first. I got a hold of another employee who was working nearby, who spoke with the receptionist on my behalf. I was then taken to the dining hall, and 45 minutes after my reservation finally seated somewhere roughly in the middle of the hall. The table was small, maybe 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep, but the bigger problem was how low the (uncomfortable) seats were to the floor. I may as well have been sitting on the floor! I was unhappy, and my date was unhappy,  and the second the waiter arrived I was going to demand a different, better table, as I could clearly see that other guests did not have to suffer the same inconvenience I did...but the waiter never came. I waited another 15 minutes, and the waiter never showed up! By this point, an hour after the reservation time, we were both completely fed up with Tao. We walked out of the dining hall to complain to a manager,  whose unacceptable resolution was that I wait another 15-30 minutes for new table. When I replied \"then we'll go somewhere else\" the manager suddenly stated that I could, in fact, be seated right away, which I perceived as deceptive. Given all the problems and grief Tao had given me in the last hour, and that it was getting late (even Manhattan restaurants start to close after 10pm), I left Tao. My date and I then walked to a nearby fine restaurant (which I have yet to review) without any reservations. I'll have you know that we were treated better there without reservations than we were at Tao with reservations! It is for this reason that I rate Tao 1 star.\n\nAnyway, let me describe some other details. Tao has a coatcheck at the entrance, which is nice. The two employees manning the coatcheck were friendly and quick to smile. The front area was immaculately clean, while the bar and dining area were moderately clean. The bar area was crowded and loud, but there is a nearby area, just as loud and crowded, with comfortable couch seating when available. The dining hall decoration is ornate and on a slope, which makes the already somewhat high ceiling look even higher. I have a mixed opinion of the dining hall because while much of the seating is nicer, mine was not; I would think the better seats would be given to those holding reservations and to regulars. I already described my generally low opinion of the reception staff and my unpleasant interaction with management. I never tried the food, so I cannot evaluate it. All in all, I do not intend to return to Tao, nor would I recommend it due to the complete lack of professionalism I was shown on my first visit.", "time": "a year ago", "rate": "Rated 1.0 out of 5,", "name": "David Thompson"}, "575": {"review": "Have a date?

My understanding is that these dishes are favorite in fast food / bistros / take out places. We ordered Pad Thai and another entree outside the restaurant week menu. Turns out that both of them are too salty to be good. Even the ice cream in the dessert is too salty.

The cameras did not reveal anything suspicious, with the manager claiming that the area we were seated in, was a busy one.

She stared at us from the other end of the restaurant, basically waiting for us to leave. She proceeded to serve other parties around us, who had more people and were ordering alcohol. I reminded her TWICE that we had asked for water and she never got it or spoke to us again. I asked a different server for the manager, who never came to us. We waited for another 10 minutes and we were completely ignored.  It became clear that all these people cared about was tips and they refused to serve us based on our age and small party.

I made a comment about how they shouldn't be on their phones and one bouncer stepped in and said in a rude way how do you know they're not working on their phone? First of all I wasn't even talking to that bouncer and he shot that answer to me in a rude way so I told him you are rude and he shot back with YOU ARE RUDE.

Save yourself the time and go somewhere else to have fun it's unprofessional and degrading. Not only that he was being rude to another woman in front of us for whatever reason.

Last night after letting me in the establishment security asked my friend (whom has also been going to Tao for the past year) to wait. After approximately ten minutes I went to ask my friend if he was ok, and comfortable waiting. Before going in I asked one of the employees whom I had know for a year, what the issue was regarding my friend. Soon during my inquiry three security guards aggressively grabbed me and forced me outside of the entrance. I am a 20 year old 120 pound girl, that was in no way aggressive towards the staff. I had three men put their hands on me, grab my arms and push me outside of the entrance, despite my compliance in the situation.  I had none of my belongings because they were inside at the table me and friends of mine had service at, and none of the staff were willing to let me grab them so that I could go home. Personal possessions of mine had been taken within the time it took for a friend of mine to retrieve my bag. This is not the first time that I have experienced Tao's staff forcibly removing a non aggressive girl from the establishment, and leaving them in the streets without their belongings. I have never in my entire life had anyone put their hands on me, and how dare this poorly managed, sexist, and racist business have the audacity too.

Let me just start by saying that my girlfriends and I have NEVER been treated as poorly as were by Kevin at Tao Downtown  Saturday August 12. The only reason I gave this a 1 star is because we were seated despite being late for our reservation. We were in town in NY for my bachelorette party weekend and were all so excited to dine at your establishment. The excitement quickly turned sour as we were seated and watched Kevin (who we later found out would be our server) walk past our table over 15 times serving everyone else except us. At some point, some 20 mins later he lack lustrely moseys over and takes our order. During the course of the next hour we had to practically wave our hands to get his attention all while we observed him laughing and giggling with the other 2 tables (one beside us and one in front of us) while he waited on them hand and foot. Turned off as yet? Well there's more. To add insult to injury, after our entr\u00e9e, (with ample time left on the reservation) Kevin made sure to have our table cleared and then flung our check on the table. No dessert menu, no coffee offer, no more wine, water NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. At that point I told him that it would have been nice had he offered us dessert before hastily bringing the check to which he replied\" OH, OKAY\" and walked off. \n\nTAO, I have never in my entire life been treated as poorly as I was on Saturday night, August 12, 2017. You RUINED what was to be such a fantastic experience for me and my friends. The sad part is that your waiter was so busy being rude that he hasn't yet realized what he has done. Since we are business women we tipped him regardless. Because to stoop to the level of ignorance would be to be ignorant.

Came from Boston for a bachelorette party. One of the girls was in touch with Francisco a Tao promoter to help us get in since we had about 8 girls in our party. We met him in the line and he saw who we were with and pointed us out to the bouncer, who refused to even make eye contact with any of us. They went back and forth whispering with eachother, while we froze in line for over an hour watching the bouncer point to everyone surrounding us and behind us and let them in. It was very clear he was allowing everyone but us in. He would pick people directly around us and behind us and let them in. Finally after wasting enough time we asked the promoter what was happening and he replied that we would not be let in tonight (no reasoning why) and that we should find \"other plans\". We ended up leaving and going to the place next door. I've been out plenty of times around Boston and dealt with some rude bouncers but this was HORRIBLE.
