All in all, the meal cost us about 30 dollars for two diners, and we were full for our night in the theater. The waitstaff was really quick and efficient, and that stands out in my mind when I think back to my experience there. They were very fast and organized, but not in a way that felt pushy.

I'm extremely disappointed with my entire experience there! I came in with a party of three. We were all fasting since we came during the month of Ramadan and during this time of fasting we traditionally break our fast with dates and water. As we were waiting for the appropriate time to eat, I offered my friends ONE date to break the fast. The moment I took out my tiny bag of 3 dates our waitress told us that we couldn't bring outside food. She didn't say it politely, she was actually yelling at us! We all explained to her that it's the month of Ramadan and that's what we do. The waitress wouldn't give us a chance to speak. Mind you we ordered so much food for the three of us. But we put the one date away. We ordered 3 plates of pad Thai, 3 orders of spring rolls, 1 order of dumplings and 3 Thai iced teas. The entire time we were there, not only our waitress but every single waiter was eyeing us down to the point I was extremely uncomfortable eating my food. I was confronted about putting too much hot chili flakes on my food. The waitress told me that they make it themselves and asked if I really needed to use that much. Why are you watching me eat? When it came time to pay the bill we said that we would spit the check so the waitress left and came back with 3 separate checks with the same amount of money. When we did it on our phones the waitress added an extra $2 per check to the total amount so an extra $6 bucks plus we had to give a tip. When I asked for the original receipt she wouldn't give it to us!! Complete scam!

The food came out in 5 minutes despite the restaurant being crowded, which was nice. The food was okay but if you're going there to order that, you're better off going somewhere else. There are other Thai places on 9th Ave that could make that dish better in my opinion.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving them one star is not because of the food but because one of the hostesses was really rude. I originally tried to order the Shrimp Pad Kee Mao. I asked the hostess if it was possible for them to take the shell off the shrimp. This is something I ask every time I order this dish, and I eat Pad Kee Mao every time I go to a Thai restaurant. She responded in a very rude and condescending way \"No, you can do that yourself. We can't do that here. We're too busy to do that here, you can do that yourself.\" In my opinion, her response could have stopped at \"no.\" This response and the way she said it was very rude and unnecessary. Again, I've asked this question at multiple restaurants before, some busier than them. Some have said \"yes\" and others have said \"no\" but none have been as rude as this woman. \n\nI didn't respond to her comment but my friend and I continued to order because we walked pretty far to get to the restaurant and we were hungry.

Immediately first bit I was in love.  It was bursting full of flavor.  I will admit I love spicy food and I love it REALLY REALLY hot.  But I think I might have over step my boundaries.  It was a little more hot than what I thought it would.  So what I recommend get it medium or mild and ask for extra sauce that way you can add a little heat as you go.

It was so awful that we didn't finish the main courses despite our hunger. \nWas extremely shocked when the waitress came back to inform us that our tips were insufficient as they charged 18% minimum. It was written on the bill that 18% tips for a  party of 5 and above but there were only 4 of us.\nService was not great and they didn't deserve even a 10% tips from us. Eventually we topped up the tips to 18%.

Luckily a few friends of mine were up for a authentic Thai experience. Inside looks as what they like to call a \"shophouse\". With wood paneling, industrial decor and a modern flair... this place is right up my alley. It's also built with a vertically oriented layout. How they fit so much seating in such little space? I'll never know.\n\nWe arrived at about 6pm on a Friday and were lucky enough to get the last seat right in the front. They brought us a nice sized carafe of water and kept our glasses full. And I now know why. I ended up ordering the Wok Basil with Chicken. Now I see that you can customize your spice level and I've never eaten there before... I'll settle on medium**. That way I can gauge for next time whether to amp it up or not. All I can say is, wow. The ground chicken and string beans were a killer. I think that chili garlic puree and holy basil sauce did a number on me. The only thing to tame the heat was that jasmine rice. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and I'd order it again. But no 3 stars for me. I'll stick to a happy 2. \n\nWe also ordered:\n-The Chicken Curry Puffs: super flaky/crispy with a moist center. (With sweet potato, onion and a cucumber relish.)\n\n-Steamed Veggie Dumplings:My favorite app. From the looks of it, I had no idea how it was going to taste as well as texture-wise. The peanut flavor was strong which I enjoyed. Pillow-y and flavorful bites.\n\nI received a fairly amount of hype for PTC and was happily surprised to see that it's completely justified and warranted here. Service was great and we didn't feel rushed despite the incoming crowds.

There is a seating area along the aisle as you enter, but you will definitely bump into some people as you go in and out.  \n\nAs you wait, there are tempting thai treats along the walls and in the front -- so you can snack as you wait.  My wait wasn't that long, so I was just looking around.\n\nThere are seats along the wall as a bar, so if you want to sit face-to-face maybe you should not come as a party of 3 or you'll probably be seated there.  If you're sitting along the bar, there will be hooks below for your things and more hooks along the opposite wall.\n\nThere are specials along the walls on a chalkboard too.  The staff were quick to respond because they want you there in and then quickly out so they can sit next parties.\n\nI had the duck soup noodle and it was delicious.  The duck had enough fat and meat to taste and I wanted to drink the entire soup because of it's not too salty, but definitely refreshing taste.  The noodles weren't soggy and just had the amount of bite to them.  It wasn't too filling and it wasn't too light -- portioned just right I felt like I ate a healthy meal.

For 2 people, we waited for about 45 minutes.  We ordered the chicken curry puffs, beef salad, and pad see ew.\n\nWe sat at the bar and surprisingly service was somewhat decent.  The food took awhile to get to us though.\n\nThe chicken curry puffs came out first and biting into it, flavors were bland, not much curry kick, and the flour seemed under cooked.  I think previous reviewers liked the softness of it and it not being overly fried but I think it's actually under cooked.  Dish was very underwhelming.  Something that I didn't expect for thai food. \n\nThe beef salad was much much better.  The meat was about medium rare which was good.  I don't like it when the beef is like jerky, that's just terrible.  I'm glad that they did not screw up such a simple dish.  It's usually the simple dishes that are really hard to do right.  All the components of the salad worked together but I wish there was mangoes in it.  The apples were sweet enough.  My only complaint is the little white \"rocks\" seasoning, I forgot what it's called but it gives texture to the dish.  However, it got stuck in my teeth and it felt like chewing on sand.  I think they should replace it with peanuts.  It's a good dish, but it needs refinement.\n\nLastly, the pad see ew.  Noodles were excellent, dish was too sweet for me and the meat was like jerky.  I think if they didn't cook the meat that long and just made it medium rare, this would have been a better well rounded dish.  I think they cooked the meat separately, then again when the noodles were being cooked.  \n\nOne surprising thing was they every now and then they would refill our glasses with water even though we were sitting at the bar.  I was happy with that.\n\nOverall, this place really lacked flavor in the dishes that we had.  Something I don't expect from a thai place.  I expect bold strong flavors.  I've never been to thailand but I doubt their authentic dishes were bland in flavor.  I also have a suspicion that the noodles here on average is not their strong suit.  I think their wok or rice dishes would be better.  I will try that if I come here again.\n\nI would recommend The Sea in Brooklyn over this place any day.", "time": "6 years ago", "rate": "Rated 3.0 out of 5,", "name": "Leo O"}, "704": {"review": "Perfect Thai restaurant, small but with amazing dishes!
