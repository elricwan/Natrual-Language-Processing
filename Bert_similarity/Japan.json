{"In leaderless Hong Kong movement, Joshua Wong just 1 voice,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Overseas, Joshua Wong has emerged as a prominent face of Hong Kong's months-long protests for full democracy. At home, he is just another protester.The 22-year-old activist, who rose to fame as a leader of democracy protests five years ago, speaks to a U.S. congressional committee on Tuesday, following visits to Germany and Taiwan to drum up support for the movement.While not diminishing the importance of that role, other protesters say Wong does not speak for what is purposefully a leaderless movement. He has received media coverage, both because he is well-known and the movement is largely faceless, since many protesters speak only anonymously and wear masks to try to avoid arrest.\"Not that nobody cares about what he says, but it's just that Joshua Wong alone cannot represent the whole of Hong Kong,\" said Sean Au, a 17-year-old student. \"He is just a participant, no longer a leader.\"His activities have nonetheless made him a target of the Chinese government, which has used him to accuse foreign powers of colluding with anti-China separatists to foment unrest.Wong's activism started at age 13 when he joined protests against a proposed high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and mainland China. The link opened last year after many delays.The bespectacled teen set up a student activist group, Scholarism, months later and rallied more than 100,000 people to protest a plan to implement mandatory patriotic education in schools. The government eventually dropped the plan.It was the 2014 Umbrella Revolution that propelled Wong into the global spotlight. Protesters occupied major thoroughfares in the semiautonomous Chinese territory for 79 days in an ultimately unsuccessful push for direct elections for the city's leaders.Wong co-founded a political party, Demosisto, in 2016, but its members were disqualified from serving and later even running for office because they advocated self-determination. He remains secretary-general of the organization, which now describes itself on Twitter as a movement-oriented youth activist group.Wong, who has been arrested and jailed repeatedly, was released in June, days after more than a million people took to the streets to protest an extradition bill which is widely regarded as an example of China chipping away at the city's autonomy.He was rearrested last month along with several others and charged with organizing an illegal rally outside a police station in June.While Wong has inspired many, neither he nor other well-known individuals or groups have a central role in this summer's mass movement, said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several massive marches this summer.Leung acknowledged that Wong's reputation as the poster child of the 2014 protest gives him stature as a protest representative on the global stage, along with others such as Hong Kong pop star Denise Ho.\"Globally we need actions that will make (the Hong Kong and Beijing governments) think twice before they act,\" she said. \"Joshua Wong is a well-known face across the world and he can help in this.\"Wong and Ho are among five people due to speak at a hearing of the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China titled \"Hong Kong's Summer of Discontent and U.S. Policy Responses.\"They hope to rally support for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill proposing economic sanctions and penalties on Chinese and Hong Kong officials found to have suppressed democracy in the city.Mousse Chan, a 45-year-old teacher, said she supports Wong in his global tour, though she echoed the view that he is not their leader.\"We believe that every Hong Kong citizen has a responsibility to raise awareness about our cause and he is just one of them,\" she said.Wong has accused the government of trying to frame prominent activists such as himself as a warning to other protesters, but he said it was doomed to fail as the current unrest has no centralized figureheads.Born in 1996 to a middle-class Christian family, Wong has said his passion was ignited after his father started taking him to poorer areas when he was a young child. He has written a book called \"I Am Not a Hero\" and featured in a Netflix documentary entitled \"Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower.\"Ahead of his trip to Germany this month, he made headlines in Berlin after suggesting that two panda cubs--born to pandas rented from China at the Berlin Zoo--be named \"Democracy\" and \"Freedom\" to send a clear signal to China.He later compared Hong Kong with East Germany during the pro-democracy protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Beijing has rebuked German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas for meeting Wong, saying he disrespected China's sovereignty.Wong tweeted Sunday that human rights clauses should be included in the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China.\"I see no reason for us to give up and it's time for the world to stand with Hong Kong,\" he said.", "Amid protests, Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downgrades Hong Kong to \u00e2\u0080\u0098negative\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,September,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Credit rating agency Moody's changed its outlook on Hong Kong's rating to negative from stable on Monday, reflecting what it called the rising risk of \"an erosion in the strength of Hong Kong's institutions\" amid the city's ongoing protests.The move follows Fitch Ratings' downgrade earlier this month on Hong Kong's long-term foreign-currency-issuer default rating to \"AA\" from \"AA+.\"\"Moody's has previously noted that a downgrade could be triggered by a shift in the current equilibrium between the SAR's (Special Administrative Region's) economic proximity to and legal and regulatory distance from China,\" Moody's said in a statement.\"The decision to change Hong Kong's outlook to negative signals rising concern that this shift is happening, notwithstanding recent moves by Hong Kong's government to accommodate some of the demonstrators' demands.\"Hong Kong's financial secretary Paul Chan said the city's government disagrees with Moody's assessment and that the inference is \"not founded on facts.\"\"In spite of the concern over the recent social incidents, Hong Kong's financial markets and its banking system have been functioning normally in the past few months. The Linked Exchange Rate System has been operating smoothly. Banks remain well capitalized with ample liquidity,\" he said in a statement.The institutional features that grant Hong Kong greater political and economic autonomy--together with the city's intrinsic credit strengths--accounted for Hong Kong's higher rating than China, the agency said.On Sunday, what began as a mostly peaceful protest descended into violence in some of the Chinese territory's busiest shopping and tourist districts. The demonstrations were the latest in over three months of sometimes violent protests.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, told a group of businessmen in late August that her \"political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited,\" because the unrest has become a national security and sovereignty issue for China.The longer the standoff continues, the greater the risk that Hong Kong's attractiveness as a global economic and financial center would be diminished, Moody's said. Dwindling capacity for the government to implement certain policies could \"undermine key drivers of its competitiveness and macroeconomic stability.\"Moody's affirmed Hong Kong's Aa2 rating, however, citing \"strong fiscal and external buffers, with a minimal government debt burden, large fiscal reserves and ample foreign exchange reserves.\"It said it would \"likely downgrade Hong Kong's rating\" if it concluded the protests, or measures taken by the Hong Kong government to resolve them, were likely to damage Hong Kong's medium-term economic prospects, or \"signify an erosion in the predictability and effectiveness of its governing, judicial and policymaking institutions.\"Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, said the rating action by the rating agencies was an early indicator and warning signal.\"I don't think there will be aggressive markets in the short run. The impact will come in the medium term. Some quasi-government agencies may need to pay higher funding costs should the third credit rating agency (S&P) downgrade Hong Kong.\"The Hong Kong dollar was little changed at 7.8201 per U.S. dollar. The currency is pegged to the dollar at a tight range of 7.75-7.85.", "Taiwan: China meddling with elections after Solomon Islands cuts ties,REUTERS,September,17,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan accused China on Monday of trying to influence its presidential and legislative elections after the Solomon Islands cut off ties with Taipei.The Solomon Islands was the sixth country to switch allegiance to China since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in Taiwan in 2016. Its decision on Monday dealt her a new blow in her struggle to secure re-election in January amid criticism of her handling of Beijing and rising tension with China.Self-ruled Taiwan now has formal relations with only 16 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.China claims Taiwan as its territory and says it has no right to formal ties with any nation.Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Tsai said Taiwan would not bow to Chinese pressure, describing the Solomon Islands' decision as new evidence that Beijing is trying to meddle in the January elections.\"Over the past few years, China has continually used financial and political pressure to suppress Taiwan's international space,\" Tsai said, calling the Chinese move \"a brazen challenge and detriment to the international order.\"\"I want to emphasize that Taiwan will not engage in dollar diplomacy with China in order to satisfy unreasonable demands,\" she said.China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said Taipei would immediately close its embassy in the Solomon Islands and recall all its diplomats.\"The Chinese government attacked Taiwan purposely before our presidential and legislative elections, obviously aiming to meddle with the voting. The government strongly condemns this and urges people to hold on to its sovereignty and the value of freedom and democracy,\" said Wu, whose resignation was rejected by Tsai. \"Taiwan has never bowed to pressure from one single setback, and it won't be defeated by this blow,\" Wu said, urging support from allies in the region to defend Taiwan's freedom and democracy.China has been trying to secure allies from Taiwan, and Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama and El Salvador had already cut off ties with Taipei.Beijing has stepped up pressure to squeeze the island, which have included regular Chinese bomber patrols around Taiwan, since Tsai took office. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for Beijing.Tsai said the Chinese move could be an \"attempt to divert attention\" from months of protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, and that China was forcing Taiwan to accept a formula similar to Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\" arrangement, which guarantees certain freedoms.\"I am confident that the 23 million people of Taiwan have this to say in response: not a chance.\" A senior official familiar with Taiwan's security planning told Reuters Beijing had issued an \"urgent order\" to secure the Solomon Islands' allegiance \"at any cost\" on Sunday night, and called it a move to distract domestic attention from the Hong Kong issue before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1.The protests in Hong Kong pose the biggest challenge for Communist Party rulers in Beijing since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.The source said the rupture in ties had prompted expressions of concern from countries including the United States, Australia and New Zealand, who had been involved in efforts to help Taiwan secure ties with the Solomon Islands.The Solomon Islands' decision followed a months-long review of the pros and cons of a switch to Beijing, which was offering $8.5 million in development funds to replace support from Taiwan.In a cabinet vote on Monday, there were 27 votes to shift ties and six abstentions, creating an \"overwhelming\" majority, a Solomon Islands member of parliament told Reuters. The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to questions.", "Hospital staff rally for protest campaign after new violence,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Hundreds of medical staff at one of Hong Kong's main public hospitals rallied Monday to support months of protests for democratic reforms and denounce police use of force, after new violence over the weekend rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Staff at the Prince of Wales Hospital, many wearing black surgical masks, sang protest songs, chanted slogans and formed a human chain, urging the government to resolve the conflict by acceding to protesters' demands, including direct elections for the city's leader and police accountability.\"I hope Hong Kong will be peaceful again. I hope police will stop indiscriminate arrests and their excessive use of force,\" said a nurse who wanted to be identified only as Ching.Hospital staff have held several rallies in support of the protest movement. However, about 500 doctors in a letter published in two newspapers on Monday supported the police handling of the crisis and said violence shouldn't be glorified.The hospital rally came after a pro-democracy march on Sunday in downtown Hong Kong descended into chaos.Thousands of people, black-clad masked protesters alongside families with children, defied a police ban and peacefully marched 2 kilometers from the Causeway Bay shopping district to the central business district. Police had turned down the march permit, but the demonstrators were undeterred, as they have been all summer.Some protesters later burned Chinese flags and vandalized subway stations. Hundreds of them targeted government buildings, throwing bricks and gasoline bombs through police barriers. Police responded by firing volleys of tear gas and using water cannon trucks to spray pepper-laced water as well as blue liquid that helped police identify offenders. Protesters retreated but regrouped in cat-and-mouse battles lasting a few hours before calm returned.Pro-Beijing supporters turned up at the North Point and Fortress Hill neighborhoods late Sunday, leading to brawls. Police said Monday that people used hammers and other weapons to attack each other, leading to a number of injuries and forcing police to deploy tear gas.Police official Tse Chun-Chung said \"radical protesters escalated their violent acts\" including throwing more than 80 gasoline bombs in the melee Sunday, briefly setting a water cannon on fire. He said some landed on other demonstrators.In one case, he said protesters hurled gasoline bombs at two police officers, who were forced to take out their pistols as a warning. Tse said the mob also assaulted pro-government supporters, including a man who was beaten until he was unconscious.Police have detained 89 people since Friday, bringing the total arrests to 1,453 since the protests started in June, he said. He said police will step up enforcement, and that \"everyone is a loser\" with the persistent violence.The Hospital Authority said 28 people were hospitalized Sunday.The government has slammed the illegal acts. It reiterated in a statement Sunday that violence would only harm the community and that it was sincerely trying to solve problems through a dialogue.The anti-government protests, sparked by an extradition bill that many Hong Kong residents see as an example of the territory's autonomy being eroded under Chinese rule, have been increasingly marked by violence and clashes with police.The government's decision this month to withdraw the bill was seen by the protesters as too little, too late. Their demands have widened, and some of the more confrontational protesters defend violence as necessary because peaceful demonstrations haven't resulted in change.In Geneva, Hong Kong lawmaker Tanya Chan urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to probe alleged police brutality against protesters. Chan said police, who have called protesters cockroaches, were carrying out \"pest control to curb free speech.\"The unrest has battered Hong Kong's economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.Protesters have vowed to keep up their protests ahead of the Oct. 1 celebration of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's 70th year in power. The Civil Human Rights Front, whose permit for the Sunday march was denied, plans rallies on Sept. 28 and Oct. 1. Several previous rallies organized by the group drew massive crowds.Eric Lai, coordinator for the group, said police have banned its rallies to silence peaceful protesters but that it only led to more anger.\"Dialogue is meaningless if the government refuses to respond to the people's demands,\" he said.", "Hong Kong reopens after weekend of clashes, protests,REUTERS,September,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's businesses and metro stations reopened as usual on Monday after a chaotic Sunday when police fired water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who blocked roads and threw petrol bombs outside government headquarters.On Sunday what began as a mostly peaceful protest earlier in the day spiraled into violence in some of the Chinese territory's busiest shopping and tourist districts.Thousands of anti-government protesters, many clad in black masks, caps and shades to obscure their identity, raced through the streets, engaging in cat-and-mouse tactics with police, setting street fires and blocking roads in the heart of Hong Kong where many key business districts are located.The demonstrations are the latest in nearly four months of sometimes violent protests. Protesters are furious over what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in Hong Kong's affairs despite promises by Beijing to grant the city wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms denied in mainland China.Dozens of university students rallied peacefully on Monday afternoon urging authorities to listen to public demands. Dressed in black, some of them donning face masks, students sang \"Glory to Hong Kong\" a song that has become a rallying cry for more democratic freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese hub.At Baptist University hundreds of students also marched to demand the university's management offer support to a student reporter arrested on Sunday.The initial trigger for the protests was a contentious extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial.The protests have since broadened into other demands including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into allegations of excessive force by the police.Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland--including a much-cherished independent legal system.Kung Lui, a third-year university student majoring in sociology, said the protests would continue until all five demands were met. \"The protests have revealed lots of social problems and proved that democracy and freedom are the core values of Hong Kong people.\"Police on Monday said 89 people were arrested over the weekend after \"radical protesters\" attacked two police officers on Sunday evening, hurling petrol bombs, bricks and threatening the safety of the officers.Nearly 1,500 people have been arrested since the protests started in June.Authorities moved quickly to douse the fires and police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse them, including in the bustling shopping and tourist district of Causeway Bay.At least 18 people were injured, three of them seriously, during Sunday's violence, according to the Hospital Authority.The protests have weighed on the city's economy as it faces its first recession in a decade, with tourist arrivals plunging 40 percent in August amid some disruptions at the city's international airport.By Sunday evening, the running battles between anti-government protesters and police had evolved into street brawls between rival groups in the districts of Fortress Hill and North Point further east on Hong Kong island. There, men in white T-shirts--believed to be pro-Beijing supporters and some wielding hammers, rods and knives--clashed with anti-government activists.On a street close to North Point, home to a large pro-Beijing community, a Reuters witness saw one man in a white T-shirt sprawled on the ground with head wounds.Hong Kong media reported that groups of pro-Beijing supporters had attacked journalists.Police eventually intervened and sealed off some roads to try to restore order, and they were seen taking away several men and women from an office run by a pro-Beijing association.Democratic lawmaker Ted Hui was arrested for allegedly obstructing police, according to his Democratic Party's Facebook page, as he tried to mediate on the streets in North Point.", "Oil prices leap as attack on Saudi facility disrupts output,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,16,2019": "Oil prices surged Monday after an attack on Saudi Arabia's largest oil processing plant halted output of more than 5.7 million barrels of crude a day.But after an initial spike, crude oil prices moderated as traders analyzed the likely longer-term implications.By late morning in Asia on Monday, U.S. crude oil was up $4.89 per barrel, or 8.9 percent, to $59.73 per barrel early Monday in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, surged $6.02 per barrel, or 10 percent, to $66.25 per barrel.Earlier, U.S. crude jumped more than 15 percent and Brent leaped nearly 20 percent.Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack on the Saudi Aramco facility that paralyzed production of more than half of Saudi Arabia's global daily exports and more than 5 percent of the world's daily crude oil production.Most of the output goes to Asia, where markets were mixed Monday in early trading. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1 percent. The benchmark in Indonesia, which heavily depends on oil imports, dropped 1.6 percent.\"To take Saudi oil production down 50 percent, that's shocking,\" said Jonathan Aronson, a research analyst at Cornerstone Macro.The attack may add to anxiety about the stability of the world's oil reserves. \"Saudi Arabia has been a very reliable supplier of oil in the world,\" said Jim Burkhard, who heads crude oil research for IHS Markit. This attack is \"adding a geopolitical premium back into the price of oil.\" That means oil prices would rise because of worries about more unrest hurting supply. Higher oil prices tend to hurt the economy as consumer costs rise.Still, existing reserves were expected to help bridge any shortfalls, and work was under way to restore production at the Abquaiq plant. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Saudi officials said a third of crude output will be restored by Monday. Bringing the entire plant back online may take weeks. Officials said they would use other facilities and existing stocks to supplant the plant's production.The world's richest countries have oil reserves of more than 2 billion barrels, but releasing those to alleviate supply concerns could potentially backfire and result in higher prices on the market as traders worry that there is a problem with tight supply, he said.According to the Joint Organization Data Initiative, Saudi Arabia has nearly 27 days worth of reserves. It holds reserves at home and in Egypt, Japan and the Netherlands.Chris Midgley, global head of analytics for S&P Global Platts, estimates prices could surge into the \"high $70\" per barrel range. It could go even higher if disruptions are prolonged, but that is not expected, he said in a research note.The situation is better today than it would have been a decade ago, thanks to the U.S. energy boom.The United States has a cushion because it and Canada both produce plenty of oil, leaving the United States less reliant on the Middle East. But it's still a global market. \"If you take oil anywhere out of system it affects everybody,\" said Burkhard.Still, even if the plant goes back online and there is no fundamental change to the world's supply of oil, prices may move higher and stay higher because traders would build in a \"security premium,\" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research.It would reflect worries that future attacks might jeopardize global oil supplies. And in a world already concerned about supply, the impact of another attack could mean a sharp effect on prices, said Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners. \"It's almost like an open season for a big attack.\"It's that element of uncertainty that can roil markets.The attack on its oil infrastructure could lead Saudi Arabia to launch a military strike on Iran in retaliation, Book said. Countries attacking each other's oil facilities and fields is a \"prescription for a high oil price,\" he said.Book argues the attack on Saudi Arabia is driving home the repercussions of the unraveling of the Iran nuclear deal after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out in 2018, imposing harsh sanctions on Iran, including its oil industry.", "Violence flares after Hong Kong protesters defy police ban,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Police fired chemical-laced blue water and tear gas at protesters who lobbed Molotov cocktails outside the Hong Kong government office complex Sunday, as violence flared anew after thousands of pro-democracy supporters marched through downtown in defiance of a police ban.A mixed crowd of hardcore protesters in black and wearing masks, along with families with children, spilled into the roads of the Causeway Bay shopping belt and marched for over 2 kilometers to the central business district. Some waved U.S. and British flags, while others carried posters reiterating their calls for democratic reforms.Police had turned down a request by the Civil Human Rights Front to hold the march, but the demonstrators were undeterred, as they've been all summer.\"I feel this is our duty. The government wants to block us with the ban, but I want to say that the people will not be afraid,\" said one protester, Winnie Leung, 50.The march disrupted traffic, and many shops, including the Sogo department store in Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong's largest department stores, closed their doors.Protesters burned Chinese flags and tore down banners congratulating China's ruling Communist Party, which will celebrate its 70th year in power on Oct. 1. In familiar scenes, some protesters smashed glass windows and surveillance cameras at a subway station exit.Hundreds of protesters later targeted the government office complex, throwing bricks and gasoline bombs through police barriers. Police responded by firing volleys of tear gas and using water cannon trucks to spray chemical-laced water as well as blue liquid that helped them identify offenders, in a repeat of confrontational scenes from the last several weeks of the protests.Protesters retreated but regrouped in the nearby Wan Chai neighborhood, setting fires outside a subway station exit and on the streets. They fled again after riot police advanced and the cat-and-mouse battles went on for a few hours before calm returned.Police fired tear gas again later in the nearby North Point area after protesters obstructed traffic after brawling there earlier with pro-government supporters.Hospital authorities said eight people were injured throughout the day, including three in serious condition.The protests were triggered in June by an extradition bill that many saw as an example of China's increasing intrusion and at chipping away at Hong Kong residents' freedoms and rights, many of which are not accorded to people in mainland China.Hong Kong's government promised this month to withdraw the bill, which would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city's leaders and police accountability.More than 1,300 people have been arrested amid increasing clashes between protesters and police, who demonstrators have accused of abuses.The unrest has battered Hong Kong's economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.Earlier Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved British flags, sang \"God Save the Queen\" and chanted \"UK save Hong Kong\" outside the British Consulate as they stepped up calls for international support for their campaign.With banners declaring \"one country, two systems is dead,\" they repeated calls for Hong Kong's former colonial ruler to ensure the city's autonomy is upheld under agreements made when Britain ceded power to China in 1997.Demonstrators held similar rallies Sept. 1 at the British Consulate and last weekend at the U.S. Consulate.On Saturday, pro-democracy protesters and supporters of the central government in Beijing clashed at a Hong Kong shopping mall and several public places. Police arrested more than a dozen people and hospital authorities said 25 were injured.The clashes amid the mid-autumn festival holiday came after several nights of peaceful rallies that featured protesters belting out a new protest song in mass singing at shopping malls. Thousands of people also carried lanterns with pro-democracy messages in public areas and formed illuminated human chains on two of the city's peaks on Friday night to mark the major Chinese festival.", "Protesters defy ban to march in downtown Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,15,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of demonstrators chanted slogans and marched through downtown Hong Kong on Sunday in defiance of a police ban, as shops shuttered amid fears of renewed violence in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that has been unsettled by months of protests.A mixed crowd of hardcore protesters in black and wearing masks, along with families with children, spilled into the roads of the Causeway Bay shopping belt and marched for over 2 kilometers to the central business district.

At least half of Hong Kong Exchanges' board and the chairman are nominated by the city's government, whose leader is ultimately appointed by China's communist rulers.The cash-and-shares offer would have valued the London Stock Exchange Group at 29.6 billion pounds ($36.9 billion). It was conditional on the group scrapping a plan to buy financial data provider Refinitiv for $27 billion.\"Given the fundamental flaws in your proposal, we see no merit in further engagement,\" Chairman Don Robert said in a letter to Hong Kong Exchanges CEO Charles Li and Chairwoman Laura Cha.One flaw it cited was a lack of \"strategic merit.\" Robert said it would be a \"significant backward step\" compared with the Refinitiv acquisition. Refinitiv's appeal is its data, viewed as a lucrative new business operation that would help the London exchange move on from being a simple trading platform.Hong Kong Exchanges said it was disappointed that the London Stock Exchange \"declined to properly engage,\" adding it had hoped to show how its proposal was better than the Refinitiv deal.The London Stock Exchange, which also owns the Milan exchange and the Russell Indexes in the U.S, noted the risk of a drawn-out approval process by U.K., U.S. and European Union regulators scrutinizing the bid.\"There is no doubt that your unusual board structure and your relationship with the Hong Kong government will complicate matters,\" Robert wrote.The London exchange said it also turned down the offer because three quarters of it was in the form of shares and the proposal fell \"substantially short of an appropriate valuation.\"Shares of the London Stock Exchange Group rose 2% in afternoon trading.", "China prods state firms to up investment in HK, sources say,REUTERS,September,13,2019": "SINGAPORE--China has called on its biggest state firms to take a more active role in Hong Kong, including stepping up investment and asserting more control of companies in the financial hub, executives familiar with the matter said, as Beijing attempts to calm months of unrest in the city.At a meeting this week in Shenzhen, the city bordering Hong Kong, senior representatives from nearly 100 of China's largest state-run companies were urged to do their part to help cool China's biggest political crisis in years, three executives, including one who was present, told Reuters.At the meeting, the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) pledged to invest more in key Hong Kong industries including real estate and tourism in a bid to create jobs for local citizens and stabilize financial markets, two of the executives said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. No specific investments were discussed or agreed upon, they said.The SOEs in attendance included oil giant Sinopec and conglomerate China Merchants Group, one of the sources said.The meeting was organized by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the powerful central body that oversees China's sprawling state sector, which includes some of the world's biggest companies in industries such as steel, energy, shipping and telecoms.SASAC did not respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. Officials at Sinopec and China Merchants Group did not respond to emailed requests for comment and calls to the two companies went unanswered.Instead of simply holding stakes in Hong Kong companies, the Chinese SOEs were also urged to look to control companies and have decision-making power in them, one of the people familiar with the meeting said.\"The business elites in Hong Kong are certainly not doing enough. Most of them are just not one of us,\" the SOE executive who was at the meeting told Reuters.SASAC's Communist Party chief, Hao Peng, appeared in Hong Kong on Wednesday at a forum for the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative and said that SOEs were looking for ways to cooperate in major projects in the city, according to a SASAC news release.Hao, who was accompanied by a group of SOE executives, also met with Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive.While China's big state firms are for-profit enterprises and many are publicly traded, they have long been expected to do national service, including maintaining high levels of employment and helping Beijing execute initiatives such as its big Belt and Road infrastructure plan.Months of huge and often-violent protests in Hong Kong were triggered by planned legislation that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland courts. The protests have been fueled by what is seen by many in Hong Kong as creeping Chinese influence that is a eroding the \"one country, two systems\" model under which China has ruled Hong Kong since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997.Widening mainland influence in Hong Kong has included the purchase of corporate assets and real estate.The Hong Kong economy was once dominated by British trading houses with roots in the 19th century. Local tycoons started to take over many of the businesses in the latter part of the 20th century, creating huge conglomerates such as Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings.Beijing has been willing to put pressure on Hong Kong businesses to be more patriotic, expressing unhappiness during an August meeting with the city's business elites that they weren't doing enough to quiet the protests, according to a report at the time by the state-run Xinhua news agency.In the meeting last month with about 500 business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians from Hong Kong, Chinese authorities urged that they should \"have no fears and stand up\" to stop violence in the city, Xinhua reported.Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., a legacy of Hong Kong's colonial era, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after Beijing demanded it suspend staff who support the demonstrations. Its chairman announced plans to step down in November, less than three weeks after CEO Rupert Hogg left amid mounting regulatory scrutiny.Hong Kong subway operator MTR Corp. also bowed to pressure in August to get tough on anti-government protesters after Chinese state media expressed dismay at the firm for its perceived facilitation of the spread of violence by protesters.", "Lam to prioritize housing, jobs to appease HK protesters,REUTERS,September,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has promised to prioritize housing and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihoods to appease deep rooted discontent about the way the Asian financial hub has been governed, as protesters gear up for fresh demonstrations.Lam, who said she caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by igniting the political crisis and would quit if she had a choice, said in a Facebook post late on Thursday her government would increase the supply of housing with more policies to be announced.While the spark for the protests that have rocked Hong Kong was a now-withdrawn extradition bill and concern Beijing was eroding civil liberties, many young protesters are also angry at sky-high living costs and a lack of future job prospects.Hong Kong has some of the world's most expensive real estate and many young people say the city's housing policy is unfair, benefiting the rich, while forcing them to live with their parents or rent \"shoe box\" apartments at exorbitant prices.Lam's comments come as activists plan the latest in a series of protests in the former British colony, which is grappling with its biggest political crisis in decades.The demonstrations started more than three months ago in response to an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts, but have broadened into calls for greater democracy.On Friday, demonstrators are set to carry lanterns and form human chains on the scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.Sit-ins at shopping malls and another \"stress test\" of the airport are also planned over the weekend. The international airport has in recent weeks seen the blocking of access roads, street fires and vandalism of a nearby subway station.Activists also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to demand that China honors the Sino-British Joint Declaration that was signed in 1984, laying out the former British colony's future after its handover to China in 1997.China says Hong Kong is now its internal affair.

There have been more requests in 2019 so far than at the same point in any of the previous five years.In 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 75 adoptions in Hong Kong, a number comparable to previous years. The Hong Kong government estimates that last year about 7,600 people left the city for good, roughly one-third the number who sought police-record printouts.Authorities in Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan have reported spikes in migration inquiries, and property agents from Melbourne to Vancouver say their phones are running hot.\"There are many uncertainties in Hong Kong,\" one investor on a property agent's late-August tour of suburban Melbourne said before, laying out A$600,000 ($410,000) for a house-and-land package.\"People like me in their 40s and 50s--we think about our child,\" said the investor, who gave only her family name, Lee, because her employer forbids speaking to the media.\"We want a back-up home, a better place to live,\" she added. \"At least if something bad happens, they have a back-up plan, an exit plan.\"And she is not alone: Lee's sentiments were echoed in interviews with 10 other families or individuals considering emigrating.China has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and the Hong Kong government has sought to head off further trouble by accepting one of the protesters' demands and withdrawing the extradition bill.A mass march scheduled for Sunday will test how far that has allayed public anger.As Hong Kong's protests have expanded during the summer, swelling to million-strong marches and calls for democracy, so too have Hong Kongers' searches for safe havens.In June, lawyers and bankers told Reuters that wealthy tycoons were shifting their fortunes to places like Singapore.Now, migration agents say, middle-class families are checking out cheaper alternatives.\"The numbers are the highest in recent years, even higher than 2014,\" said Peggy Lau, a sales director at Uni Immigration Consultancy in Hong Kong, where inquiries have surged sevenfold since protests began in June.To be sure, there is no official data tracking emigration applications from Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7 million. Nor is there evidence of departures or cash outflows on the scale of those in the aftermath of the 1997 handover from Britain to China.But there are firm signs of preparations.Favored destinations such as Malaysia, which is relatively cheap, and Taiwan, which is culturally similar to Hong Kong, show sharp rises in interest.At Johor, near Malaysia's southern tip, property consultant Bruce Lee said Hong Kongers have poured into a project called Forest City, developed by China's Country Garden Holdings Co., Ltd., buying 800 units since June.That compares with 200 units purchased between then and 2016, when sales began.The number of visas issued to Hong Kongers in Taiwan in June and July was 38 percent higher, at 884, than in the same period a year ago, according to the island's Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency.Inquiries by Hong Kongers at Immigration@SG LLP, an immigration consultancy in Singapore, rose by roughly a quarter in the past two months compared with earlier in the year, said a company spokesman, Muhammad Ryhan.State authorities in Australia have noted a \"significant\" increase in visa inquiries from Hong Kong, but declined to give details. Immigration agents have said there is also growing interest in Canada, the United States and Ireland.In New Zealand, the number of monthly applicants for residency visas from Hong Kong passport holders hit 34 in June and 44 in July, modestly higher than the average of 29.There are signs that property investors are laying the groundwork for a move as well.Hong Kong's famously frothy real estate market, worth $1.3 trillion, is shrinking, with prices edging lower for a second consecutive month in July and transaction volumes forecast to hit a six-month low.Peter Wong, a property agent in Sydney, has taken a half-dozen calls from Hong Kong buyers in the last month, the first he can remember in decades. Some agents have also reported sudden interest in Taiwan and Vancouver.There are no signs yet of an effect on prices in destination markets, but demand is strong enough that agents and developers say they have begun actively courting Hong Kongers.\"We see there is an opportunity,\" said Ken Dodds, sales director at Melbourne homebuilder Resimax, which hosted 43 Hong Kong investors last month, after previously focusing on buyers from Malaysia and Singapore.\"People are keen to look for a safe haven,\" he said, adding that the investors bought or reserved a dozen properties, which he described as a \"great\" result.It is a trend some in the market expect to continue.\"This episode has planted a seed in many Hong Kongers with Canadian ties to begin the process of moving money, assets, and family out of Hong Kong and back to Canada,\" Dan Scarrow, president of Vancouver-based Macdonald Realty told Reuters.\"This process will play out over the coming years, not over the coming weeks,\" he said.", "Belting out karaoke new protest method in Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of Hong Kong people belted out a new protest song in karaoke-style at shopping malls in the latest act of resistance that highlighted the creativity of demonstrators in their months-long fight for democratic freedoms in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.Late Wednesday, activists and ordinary citizens sang \"Glory to Hong Kong\" at several malls for a third straight night in a respite from recent violence clashes. More protests are expected this weekend, though on Thursday police banned one planned rally, citing safety concerns.The protesters have adopted the song, penned anonymously, as their anthem. The lyrics reflect protesters' vow not to surrender despite a government concession to ax an extradition bill that sparked the summer of unrest.At the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin district, some 2,000 people spread across several floors chanted slogans before breaking out into song in an emotional scene, with some crying with their hands to their hearts while others lifted their hands in the air. Many referred to lyrics on their phone as they sang a cappella.The crowd included families with young children, students and senior citizens, many of them not wearing masks, the usual attire of protesters. The busy mall is linked to a subway station where police fired tear gas on Sunday after protesters vandalized the station.Local media showed singing taking place in at least four other malls, as well as in some spots including outside a subway station. The South China Morning Post said participants responded to online calls to gather and sing. Police were absent and the gatherings dispersed peacefully.The song has been sung at almost every protest since it emerged Aug. 31, including during a World Cup qualifier match on Tuesday with Iran where Hong Kong soccer fans booed at the Chinese national anthem before kick-off.The sing-alongs have boosted protesters' morale and highlighted their creativity in inventing new ways to get their message heard by the authorities.On Thursday, hundreds of pro-Beijing supporters staged a counter protest during lunchtime at a swank mall downtown, singing the Chinese national anthem and waving red five-star national flags.Protesters have widened their demands to include calls for direct elections for the city's leaders and police accountability. Many saw the extradition bill, that would have sent some suspected criminals to China for trial, as a glaring example of the city's eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several massive rallies, said Thursday it is appealing the police ban on its planned march Sunday.Police had also banned the group's Aug. 31 march but protesters turned up anyway. Violent clashes erupted that night, with police storming a subway car and hitting passengers with batons and pepper spray.Front coordinator Bonnie Leung said police noted the proposed route would pass close to high-risk buildings including the police headquarters, government offices and subway stations that have been a focus of protests in recent weeks.She said police also told the group they cannot stop protesters from breaking away and carrying out illegal violent acts. But Leung said violent clashes were unrelated to the group.\"We create a safe zone for people to protest. Our marches are like Hong Kong people giving a chance to the government to end the crisis peacefully but now, they have closed the valve to release public anger. It's like declaring war to peaceful protesters,\" she told the Associated Press.Leung accused authorities of trying to provoke protesters to carry out illegal gatherings to find an excuse to crack down. She urged activists \"not to fall into the trap,\" saying protests can be in many forms and that they should keep safe to sustain the protest movement.", "Mid-Autumn Festival lantern protests to light up Hong Kong,REUTERS,September,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activists will combine anti-government protests with lantern celebrations marking the Mid-Autumn Festival this weekend after a brief lull in sometimes violent demonstrations that have rocked the Chinese-ruled city since June.The protests include another in a series of \"stress tests\" of the airport, which in recent weeks have seen approach roads blocked, street fires started and the trashing of a nearby MTR subway station.Protesters also jammed the airport arrivals hall last month, leading to canceled or delayed flights and clashes with police.The Mid-Autumn Festival is a harvest celebration throughout the Chinese-speaking world and in East and Southeast Asia. It is celebrated with mooncakes, gazing at the full moon and colorful lantern displays and falls on Friday this year.Protesters plan a series of lantern-carrying human chains and sit-ins at MTR shopping malls and on the city's scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.There were brief scuffles, pushing and hair pulling, between pro-Beijing and anti-Hong Kong government supporters in the mall of the IFC, a prominent skyscraper on the newly reclaimed Central waterfront. Some top-brand stores were closed.Police denied the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) permission for a mass downtown march on Sunday.\"In previous marches applied for by CHRF, participants, reporters and police suffered serious injuries,\" police said in their refusal letter to the group.\"Some protesters acted violently and blocked the main road and even used petrol bombs, bricks and iron bars to damage public facilities and social peace.\"The group has appealed.Police have responded to violence with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannon and baton charges, prompting complaints of excessive force.Protesters also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to make sure China honors the Sino-British Joint Declaration which was signed in 1984, laying out the former British colony's future.China says Hong Kong is now its internal affair.

A deal with Hong Kong would be contingent on that deal being abandoned.Hong Kong exchange CEO Charles Li acknowledged the company was coming late with its offer, but hoped to win over the London firm in a \"corporate Romeo and Juliet\" story.Refinitiv's appeal is its data, viewed as a lucrative new business operation that would help the London exchange move on from being a simple trading platform.In Hong Kong's favor is that a deal in Asia would give the London exchange, which also owns the Milan bourse and the Russell Indexes in the United States, access to a new market whenever it leaves the EU. As things stand, Britain is due to leave the EU, which it has been a part of for 46 years and with which it has extensive and deep economic ties, on Oct. 31.If it leaves without a divorce deal, then tariffs and more red tape will be imposed on trade with the other 27 European Union countries. Financial services are a big part of the British economy and a no-deal Brexit will lead to a period of disruption, at least in the short-term.Britain's pro-Brexit government has proclaimed its desire to turn to markets beyond Europe to shore up business and London's role as a financial hub, so a deal in Asia for the London exchange could be viewed as an asset.\"A combined group will be strongly placed to benefit from the dynamic and evolving macroeconomic landscape, whilst enhancing the long-term resilience and relevance of London and Hong Kong as global financial centers,\" Li argued.For the Hong Kong exchange, the potential deal has been made cheaper by the 20 percent-or-so fall in the pound in the wake of the country's 2016 decision to leave the EU. The currency this summer trended down toward its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, effectively making British companies cheaper. That's certainly the case for companies in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar.For the Hong Kong exchange, the deal could help it diversify at a time of tensions in the city over the Chinese government's influence. Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong after Beijing's attempts to exert greater control have created uncertainty over the city's role as an international business hub.But the protests, if anything, could harden opposition by the London exchange, its shareholders or British authorities.\"There is a very high bar to clear in order for this to succeed,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.", "Hong Kong stock exchange in talks to buy London bourse,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,11,2019": "LONDON--The Hong Kong stock exchange says it has started talks to buy the London Stock Exchange that would value the British company at 29.6 billion pounds ($36.6 billion or 3.9 trillion yen).The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. said Wednesday that a deal would provide the London Stock Exchange with a key opening to Asian markets and underpin the British capital's role as a financial hub.The offer comes at a time of heightened uncertainty for London and British companies because of Brexit, which threatens to create barriers to trade for the country. A weakened pound has also made U.K. companies cheaper takeover targets.The Hong Kong exchange is required to make a binding offer by Oct. 9.", "Hong Kong protesters hit pause to mark Sept. 11 attacks,REUTERS,September,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activists called off protests on Wednesday in remembrance of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and denounced a Chinese state newspaper report that they were planning \"massive terror\" in the Chinese-ruled city.Hong Kong has been rocked by months of sometimes violent unrest, prompted by anger over planned legislation that would have allowed extraditions to China but broadening into calls for democracy and for Communist Party rulers in Beijing to leave the city alone.\"Anti-government fanatics are planning massive terror attacks, including blowing up gas pipes, in Hong Kong on September 11,\" the Hong Kong edition of the China Daily said on its Facebook page on Tuesday alongside a picture of the attacks on the twin towers in New York.\"The 9/11 terror plot also encourages indiscriminate attacks on non-native speakers of Cantonese and starting mountain fires,\" it said.

Iran, Asia's top team, had sought to move the match, citing safety concerns over the unrest, but the request was rejected by FIFA, soccer's governing body.Stadium announcers said 14,000 spectators attended the game.Iran beat Hong Kong 2-0.\"Hong Kong people are united. We will speak up for freedom and democracy,\" one of the spectators, Leo Fan, said as members of the crowd continued to chant slogans and sing protest songs as they left.In July, Hong Kong fans chanted slogans and waved banners when English Premier League champions Manchester City played local team Kitchee at the stadium.Many see the extradition bill as a glaring example of the city's eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997. Clashes have become increasingly violent, with police firing tear gas after protesters vandalized subway stations, set street fires and blocked traffic over the weekend.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam renewed an appeal to protesters earlier Tuesday to \"say no to violence\" and engage in dialogue, as the city's richest man urged the government to provide a way out for the mostly young demonstrators.Lam said the escalation of violence, in which more than 150 people including students have been detained in clashes since Friday, will deepen rifts and prolong the road to recovery.She said her decision to formally withdraw the extradition bill and her other initiatives reflected her sincerity to heal society by initiating a direct dialogue with various communities, including protesters.Billionaire Li Ka Shing, in a video broadcast on local TV, described the summer of unrest as the worst catastrophe since World War II. In his first public comments, Li called youths the \"masters of our future\" and said the government should temper justice with mercy in resolving the crisis.\"I am very worried. We hope Hong Kong people will be able to ride out the storm. We hope the young people can consider the big picture and those at the helm can give the masters of our future a way out,\" Li, 91, told a religious gathering outside a Buddhist temple over the weekend.Asked about Li's comments, Lam agreed that the government \"can do more and can do better\" especially in meeting young people to hear their grievances.But she stressed the government cannot condone violence and will strictly enforce the law.The unrest has become the biggest challenge to Beijing's rule since it took over Hong Kong and is an embarrassment to its ruling Communist Party ahead of Oct. 1 celebrations of its 70th year in power. Beijing has slammed the protests as an effort by criminals to split the territory from China, backed by what it said were hostile foreigners.Beijing rebuked Germany on Tuesday for allowing prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong to visit \"to engage in anti-China separatist activities.\"Wong met Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Berlin late Monday at an event hosted by the German newspaper Bild.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Maas' \"political show\" with Wong displayed disrespect to China's sovereignty and was an interference in its internal affairs. She urged Germany to avoid sending the wrong signal to \"radical, separatist forces in Hong Kong\" and said any efforts to solicit foreign support to split the country are \"doomed to fail.\"In an immediate response, Wong tweeted that Chinese 's strong reaction was \"baffling.\"Wong, a leader of Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protest movement, was charged last month with inciting people to join a protest in June.

China has retaliated with its own duties.Chinese trade deputies are expected to meet with their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in Washington before minister-level meetings in early October in the U.S. capital, involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.U.S. tariffs of 15 percent on about $125 billion (13 trillion yen) worth of goods took effect on Sept. 1, and tariffs on virtually all remaining Chinese imports, including cellphones and laptop computers, are scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15. Tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods are due to rise by 5 percentage points to 30 percent on Oct. 1.Navarro said the tariffs were \"working beautifully.\"\"People need to understand this: the tariffs on China are our best defense against China's economic aggression and best insurance policy--this is important--the best insurance policy that China will continue to negotiate in good faith,\" he said.The South China Morning Post reported, citing an unidentified source, that China was expected to buy more agricultural products in hopes of a better trade deal with the United States.American and Chinese trade officials would discuss a deal based on a draft text that was negotiated in April before the talks broke down in May, the Hong Kong-based newspaper said.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called for a high-standard comprehensive agreement to lift the uncertainty.\"The time is now to strike a deal that addresses the U.S.'s legitimate concerns about market access, forced technology transfer, subsidies, and digital trade, while concurrently removing punitive and retaliatory tariffs,\" U.S. Chamber international affairs director Myron Brilliant said in remarks to an audience in Beijing.\"Without a truly effective agreement, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see an alternative path to reestablishing bilateral economic stability,\" Brilliant added.The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday levied preliminary anti-subsidy duties of 104 percent to 222 percent on Chinese-made ceramic tiles, a popular item in U.S. home improvement stores.The Commerce finding that the tile exports were unfairly subsidized affects about $483 million worth of Chinese imports, which have already been hit with 25 percent tariffs.", "SOCCER/ Japan defeats Myanmar 2-0 in World Cup qualifier,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,11,2019": "SEOUL--Japan started on the road to the 2022 World Cup by beating Myanmar 2-0 in Yangon on Tuesday.A spectacular strike from outside the area by Shoya Nakajima after 16 minutes put Japan in control.

He will stay on as a member of the Alibaba Partnership, a 36-member group with the right to nominate a majority of the company's board of directors.Ma, a former English teacher, founded Alibaba in 1999 to connect Chinese exporters to American retailers.The company has shifted focus to serving China's growing consumer market and expanded into online banking, entertainment and cloud computing. Domestic businesses accounted for 66 percent of its $16.7 billion (1.8 trillion yen) in revenue in the quarter ending in June.Chinese retailing faces uncertainty amid a tariff war that has raised the cost of U.S. imports.Growth in online sales decelerated to 17.8 percent in the first half of 2019 amid slowing Chinese economic growth, down from 2018's full-year rate of 23.9 percent.Alibaba says its revenue rose 42 percent over a year earlier in the quarter ending in June to $16.7 billion and profit rose 145 percent to $3.1 billion. Still, that was off slightly from 2018's full-year revenue growth of 51 percent.The total amount of goods sold across Alibaba's e-commerce platforms rose 25 percent last year to $853 billion. By comparison, the biggest U.S. e-commerce company, Amazon.com Inc., reported total sales of $277 billion.Alibaba's deputy chairman, Joe Tsai, told reporters in May the company is \"on the right side\" of issues in U.S.-Chinese trade talks. Tsai said Alibaba stands to benefit from Beijing's promise to increase imports and a growing consumer market.Alibaba is one of a group of companies including Tencent Holding Ltd., a games and social media giant, search engine Baidu.com Inc. and e-commerce rival JD.com that have revolutionized shopping, entertainment and consumer services in China.Alibaba was founded at a time when few Chinese were online. As Internet use spread, the company expanded into consumer-focused retailing and services. Few Chinese used credit cards, so Alibaba created the Alipay online payments system.Ma, known in Chinese as Ma Yun, appears regularly on television. At an annual Alibaba employee festival in Hanzhou, he has sung pop songs in costumes that have included blond wigs and leather jackets. He pokes fun at his own appearance, saying his oversize head and angular features make him look like the alien in director Steven Spielberg's movie \"E.T. The Extraterrestrial.\"The company's $25 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014 was the biggest to date by a Chinese company.The Hurun Report, which follows China's wealth, estimates Ma's fortune at $38 billion.In 2015, Ma bought the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's biggest English-language newspaper.Ma's successor as chairman is CEO Daniel Zhang, a former accountant and 12-year veteran of Alibaba. He previously was president of its consumer-focused Tmall.com business unit.Alibaba's e-commerce business spans platforms including business-to-business Alibaba.com, which links foreign buyers with Chinese suppliers of goods from furniture to medical technology, and Tmall, with online shops for popular brands.Alipay became a freestanding financial company, Ant Financial, in 2014. Alibaba also set up its own film studio and invested in logistics and delivery services.Ma faced controversy when it disclosed in 2011 that Alibaba transferred control over Alipay to a company he controlled without immediately informing shareholders including Yahoo Inc. and Japan's Softbank.Alibaba said the move was required to comply with Chinese regulations, but some financial analysts said the company was paid too little for a valuable asset. The dispute was later resolved by Alibaba, Yahoo and Softbank.Corporate governance specialists have questioned the Alibaba Partnership, which gives Ma and a group of executives more control over the company than shareholders.Ma has said that ensures Alibaba focuses on long-term development instead of responding to pressure from financial markets.", "Lam: Escalation of violence will not solve HK social issues,REUTERS,September,10,2019": "HONG KONG--An escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in Hong Kong, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday, adding that she deeply regretted interference by foreign parliaments in the Asian financial hub's matters.Lam was speaking after another weekend of sometimes violent clashes in the former British colony, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in cat-and-mouse skirmishes, at times smashing windows and starting street fires.\"It's extremely inappropriate for foreign parliaments to interfere in HKSAR internal affairs in any way, and (we) will not allow (the United States) to become a stakeholder in HKSAR matters,\" Lam said, referring to Hong Kong's status as a special administrative region of China.During a rally at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators had called for help in bringing democracy to Hong Kong.The protesters wanted the U.S. Congress to pass legislation that would require Washington to make an annual assessment of whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to retain special U.S. trade and economic benefits.Chinese officials have accused foreign forces of trying to hurt Beijing by creating chaos in Hong Kong, and warned other nations against interfering in what they called an internal affair.On Monday, former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the anti-government protests were \"not an internal\" Chinese matter and the United States should offer at least moral support to the demonstrators.After three months of unrest, Lam last week withdrew a controversial extradition bill that had triggered the protests, but the gesture failed to appease many demonstrators, who are using the popularity of the movement to revive old grievances.Anger over the now-shelved extradition bill has triggered public opposition to Beijing that had dwindled after 2014, when authorities faced down a pro-democracy movement that occupied streets for 79 days in the central business district.\"Escalation and continuation of violence cannot solve the issues faced by our society now,\" Lam told a news conference on Tuesday. \"It will only deepen the conflict, contradiction, splits, and even hatred in society.\"Many initially peaceful protests in the past three months have degenerated into encounters between baton-wielding riot police and activists, leading to scores of injuries and about 1,300 arrests.The protests, beamed live to the world since June, have prompted some of the city's powerful tycoons to appeal for calm.In his first speech mentioning the unrest, billionaire Li Ka-shing urged political leaders to offer young people an olive branch, calling them \"masters of our future,\" according to an online video of remarks to a small crowd during a monastery visit on Sunday.Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.

the struggle of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters to the role of Berlin during the Cold War, activist Joshua Wong told an audience in the German capital that his city was now a bulwark between the free world and the \"dictatorship of China.\"The 22-year-old activist, who was in Berlin for a newspaper-sponsored event at the German parliament celebrating human rights activists around the world, pledged that protests would not be lulled into complacency by the decision of the city's government to drop a contested new extradition law.\"If we are in a new Cold War, Hong Kong is the new Berlin,\" he said in a reception space a stone's throw from the Berlin Wall on the roof of the Reichstag building, which for decades occupied the no-man's land between Communist East Berlin and the city's capitalist western half.Hong Kong has been convulsed by months of unrest since its government announced attempts to make it easier to extradite suspects to China, a move seen as a prelude to bringing the pluralistic autonomous region more in line with the mainland.Wong, leader of the Demosisto pro-democracy movement, has become a prominent face of the protests.\"We urge the free world to stand together with us in resisting the Chinese autocratic regime,\" he added, describing Chinese leader Xi Jinping as \"not a president but an emperor.\"The city's leader, Carrie Lam, announced

anti-government protesters after another weekend of clashes in the Chinese-ruled city.Metro stations reopened after some were closed on Sunday amid sometimes violent confrontations, although the mood in the Asian financial hub remained tense.Early on Monday, before school started, rows of students and alumni joined hands chanting \"Hong Kong people, add oil,\" a phrase which has become a rallying cry of encouragement for the protest movement.\"The school-based human chain is the strongest showcase of how this protest is deep rooted in society, so deep rooted that it enters through the school students,\" said Alan Leong, an alumnus of Wah Yan College in the city's Kowloon district.Three months of protests over a now withdrawn extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the government and greater calls for democracy.The former British colony is facing its first recession in a decade as the protests scare off tourists and bite into retail sales in one of the world's most popular shopping destinations.Tourist arrivals plunged 40 percent in August year on year, said Paul Chan, the city's finance secretary, with sustained clashes leading to main roads being shrouded in teargas and blocked, and the international airport shut down--hitting the tourism, retail and hotel industries.\"The most worrying thing is that the road ahead is not easily going to turn any better,\" Chan said in his blog on Sunday, noting that some hotels had seen room rates plunge up to 70 percent.Activists started fires in the street and vandalized a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in the main business district of Central on Sunday after thousands rallied peacefully at the U.S. consulate, calling for help in bringing democracy to the special administrative region.The students, brandishing posters with the protesters' five demands for the government, called on authorities to respond to the promises of freedom, human rights and rule of law.University students were also expected to join the human chain protests during the day on their campuses.One of the five demands--to formally withdraw the extradition bill--was announced last week by the city government leader, Carrie Lam, but protesters are angry about her failure to call an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality during demonstrations.The protesters' other demands include the retraction of the word \"riot\" to describe demonstrations, the release of all those arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.In a rare public appearance, Lam walked around the central business district with the city's Transport and Housing Secretary Frank Chan and MTR officials to inspect the damaged station, where she chatted with staff and commuters.Dressed in a black suit, she examined electronic ticketing machines and boarded up windows smashed the previous day, the public broadcaster RTHK showed.Following the demonstration at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, Hong

But the president has suggested that it's a matter for China to handle, though he also has said that no violence should be used.

In recent years, German companies have been unhappy about being barred from acquiring most Chinese assets at a time when China's companies have been on a global buying spree.The economic ties make it harder for Merkel to satisfy a U.S. diplomat and activists who have urged her to raise human rights issues such as China's treatment of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as the three months of pro-democracy demonstrations that have roiled Hong Kong.Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Thursday that China's \"willful disregard of its commitments\" to Hong Kong and human rights violations in Xinjiang show that its ruling Communist Party \"stands against the values Germany cherishes.\"\"We hope that Chancellor Merkel will take a firm stance for the values that unified Germany after the fall of Communism: human rights, democracy and the rule of law,\" he said.Hong Kong activists also warned Merkel about dealing with \"authoritarian and unjust regimes\" in an open letter published this week in Germany's Bild newspaper.On the question of what Merkel might say about Hong Kong, a senior German official said the talks with Xi and Li will be conducted \"comprehensively in terms of thematic breadth, and open and friendly in terms of tone--with a readiness to express criticism where we think things are worthy of criticism.\"The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in line with department rules.China has bristled at what it calls foreign interference from countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. on political tumult in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city where activists have staged three months of mass protests calling for democratic reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct.On Friday, Merkel will also visit German engineering company ZF Fredrichshafen in Beijing. She travels Saturday to Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province, where she will inaugurate the plant expansion at German auto supplier Webasto and speak at Wuhan University.", "Hong Kong students form human chains in continuing protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,6,2019": "HONG KONG--Students and alumni from at least five Hong Kong schools formed human chains Friday to raise awareness for the remaining four demands of protesters involved in months of demonstrations in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.The continuing act of defiance came two days after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced that her government will be formally withdrawing an extradition bill that sparked the demonstrations. The proposed legislation would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial.Despite the hard-fought concession, some protesters have said they will continue their resistance because the government has committed to fulfilling only one of their five demands, which include electoral reforms and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to China in 1997 under the so-called \"one country, two systems\" framework, which promised the territory certain democratic rights not afforded to the mainland. In recent years, however, some Hong Kong residents have accused Beijing of steadily eroding those freedoms.Students in blue school dresses held hands Friday outside the Maryknoll Convent School, a Catholic girls' school. They paired their uniforms with surgical masks, in the style of protesters who wear masks to conceal their identities and mitigate the effects of tear gas. Alumni from various schools and clad in protesters' trademark black also joined similar chains in the district.One young man dressed in a shirt bearing his school's emblem held up a placard that said \"Freedom.\"The demonstrations that began in June have become increasingly violent in recent weeks, with protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and police officers using tear gas, batons and water cannons. More than 1,000 people have been arrested.While the extradition bill was the trigger for the movement, it has since shifted its target toward the police, who have been accused of using excessive force. The authorities say they have only used the minimum amount of force necessary to quell riotous demonstrators.Lam on Wednesday said her government would not accept the other demands, and instead named two new members to an existing police watchdog agency investigating police conduct.", "EDITORIAL: Hong Kong leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belated move will not end public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distrust,editor,September,6,2019": "Many people in Hong Kong continue protesting vigorously against the government.However, making formal concessions is not what the governments in Beijing and Hong Kong have to do now.Instead, they need to get down to the heart of the problems that have led to the wave of unrest in the former British colony in recent months and carry out reforms to respect people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freedom and autonomy.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Sept. 4 the extradition bill that set off a flurry of fierce civil protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory will be formally withdrawn in the legislative council.The move came far too late after three months of massive and angry street demonstrations that have pushed the situation into increasingly deeper chaos.During the period, many dark scenes of clashes between protesting citizens and police have unfolded in the usually vibrant metropolis.The unrest in the city has not just hurt its society and economy but also augmented people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distrust of the local authority.If the Hong Kong government had paid serious attention to what the protesters were saying from the beginning and sought dialogue with them, the situation would not have become so convoluted.Much of the blame for the chaos should be placed on the local government.In a televised speech to announce her decision to withdraw the bill, Lam said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replace conflicts with conversations.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt is, however, unclear whether this step alone will really calm the turmoil.The demonstrators are now demanding five steps from the government, including the establishment of an independent fact-finding committee to look into acts of violence committed by police and the introduction of a democratic election system.Withdrawing the bill only represents the least difficult step to take for the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.At the root of the full-blown civil protest movement is people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fear that Hong Kong society may be completely incorporated into the system for the Communist Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monopoly on power.The ethos of freedom took root in Hong Kong when the city was under British rule. Its economy has been growing under a judicial system that places great importance on equality among citizens.When Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, Beijing promised a \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach to administration of the city as a gesture of respect for its history.Over time, however, the Chinese government has taken a series of actions that unmistakably reflect Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention to focus only on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country\u00e2\u0080\u009d part of the promise while gradually eroding the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d part of the principle.These actions have been intended as either tangible or intangible pressure on freedom of speech and economic activities in Hong Kong.How the Hong Kong government has responded to the civil disturbance has also made abundantly clear that the local administration is under the Chinese government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unchallengeable control. Many people in Hong Kong fear and reject the prospect of Hong Kong morphing into a society where the Communist Party has the final say on everything.It has been reported that Beijing wants to calm the situation by Oct. 1, when it will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China.Top Chinese government officials have not ruled out the possibility of using armed force or other means for direct intervention in the crisis. But Beijing should immediately stop such high-handed attempts to intimidate Hong Kong protesters.In her speech, Lam also pledged to create a new framework for dialogue with \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople from all walks of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe should immediately start leading the Hong Kong government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to have constructive talks with citizens on how it should respond to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views and opinions and how it should incorporate them into its policy initiatives, including the proposal to introduce a democratic election system.--The Asahi Shimbun, Sept. 6", "Hong Kong braces for weekend protests as leader fails to appease activists,REUTERS,September,6,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong is bracing for more demonstrations this weekend, with protesters threatening to disrupt transport links to the airport as embattled leader Carrie Lam's withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill fails to appease some activists.Protesters plan to block traffic to the city's international airport on Saturday, a week after thousands of demonstrators disrupted transport links, which saw some of the worst violence since the unrest escalated three months ago.The Airport Authority, in an advert in the South China Morning Post newspaper on Friday, urged protesters \"not to disrupt the journey of tens of thousands of travelers who use the airport every day.\"In a pre-recorded televised address on Wednesday, Lam said the extradition bill had been withdrawn, conceding to one of the protesters' five demands, although many said the move was too little, too late.The extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, triggered mass protests that have now evolved into a broader backlash against the Hong Kong government and its political masters in Beijing.The massive and sometimes violent protests present Chinese President Xi Jinping with his greatest popular challenge since he came to power in 2012.Many protesters remain angry over Lam's refusal to grant an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality against protesters. Police have fired tear gas and bean bag rounds at protesters, who in turn have thrown petrol bombs and bricks at police in running battles across the Asian financial hub.The protesters' three other demands are: retraction of the word \"riot\" to describe rallies, release of all demonstrators arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to the former British colony when it was handed back to China in 1997.China denies the charge of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy and the possible use of force to quell the unrest.

Those also include an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality during the protests, the unconditional release of those detained, not labelling the protests as riots, and direct elections of the city's leader.The massive but peaceful demonstrations began in June against the legislation, which would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but clashes with police have become increasingly violent as the demands evolved into a wider call for democracy.Demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at officers last weekend protests and police retaliated with water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons.

They respect my view, and they support me all the way.\"Lam voiced hope that the bill's withdrawal and other measures to address society discontent will provide an \"important basis\" to open dialogue to seek a way out of the impasse.Lam, who was elected as the city's chief executive by a pro-Beijing committee of Hong Kong elites, has come under withering criticism for pushing the extradition bill. Many in Hong Kong saw the bill as a glaring example of the city's eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.The bill's withdrawal, widely seen as a bid to halt the unrest that could embarrass China during its National Day celebrations on Oct. 1, has been slammed as \"too little, too late\" by both government supporters and demonstrators.Dozens of demonstrators took to the streets in some areas overnight shouting \"five key demands, not one less.\" Local media reported that protesters built barriers near a police station at Mong Kok and pointed laser beams at police but fled after riot police confronted them.Students also reportedly staged protests outside some schools Thursday, forming human chains across streets to show their support for those detained by the government.More protests are planned for the weekend, including another one at the airport. The airport has been the site of several protests, causing flight disruptions and cancelations, as protesters seek to drum up international support.The mostly young protesters say a degree of violence is necessary to get the government's attention after peaceful rallies were futile.

The choice of resigning, it's my own choice,\" Lam said.\"I told myself repeatedly in the last three months that I and my team should stay on to help Hong Kong ... That's why I said that I have not given myself the choice to take an easier path and that is to leave.\"Lam added that she was disappointed that comments made in a private meeting, where she had been sharing the \"journey of my heart,\" had been leaked.A spokeswoman for China's central government said it fully supported Lam and the Hong Kong administration to use all lawful means to put an end to violent protests.Comments on the Reuters story appeared to be censored on mainland Chinese social media, although state media covered Lam's news conference.The growing unrest has evolved into a broader call for Chinese-ruled Hong Kong to be granted greater autonomy by Beijing, which has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.In the audio recording, Lam said that her ability to resolve the crisis was \"very, very limited\" as she had to serve \"two masters\" and the issue had been elevated \"to a national level,\" a reference to the leadership in Beijing.But Lam said on Tuesday that her government had the confidence of Beijing and could bring an end to unrest itself.\"I think I can lead my team to help Hong Kong to walk out from this dilemma.

They argue that it is useless to study if they have no meaningful future to contemplate.An 18-year-old female secondary school student said she felt that Hong Kong was being swallowed up by the mainland as Beijing tries to effectively change the \"one nation, two systems\" agreement that had been promised for 50 years after Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.\"I am fearful for what Hong Kong will turn into when I become an adult,\" she said. \"I will continue with the protest because my future depends on it.\"Another 15-year-old secondary school student said the use of tear gas by police to disperse crowds had turned Hong Kong into a battlefield in recent months.Under the one nation, two systems framework, Hong Kong's educational system differs from the one in mainland China.Many of today's secondary school students were heavily influenced by the so-called umbrella movement that flourished five years ago when young activists called for greater democracy in Hong Kong. Even as Hong Kong authorities tried to instill patriotism in the students, many young people hold mixed feelings toward China.But unlike five years ago, when the movement had a charismatic leader in the form of Joshua Wong, 22, who outlined the democratic changes that were needed, the protesters today lack a strong leader.Now, it appears that those capturing the hearts of the students are the more radical young activists who take their places in the front line, making them the first targets of police trying to break up the rallies.\"We can hold these protests because they are protecting us from the police,\" said one fourth-year secondary school student. \"I would also stand at the forefront if I had more confidence in my physical condition.\"Authorities in recent days have taken stricter measures to regain control.On Sept. 2, the police said they detained 159 people, including minors as young as 13. Since June, more than 1,000 people have been detained.Despite images beamed around the world of swarms of protesters thronging the streets of Hong Kong, it emerges that the vast majority of young students are not that sympathetic to the cause.An 18-year-old sixth-year secondary school student, referring to the controversial extradition measure that sparked the fury, said about 20 percent of his classmates opposed the measure to extradite criminal suspects from Hong Kong to stand trial in China.The student said that about half of his classmates had little or no interest in the issue, while about 30 percent supported the government and police.Some schools in Hong Kong refuse to discipline those who boycott classes, while others strictly prohibit such activity on grounds students should focus on learning.A 50-year-old English teacher said she was taking part in the protest as an individual.Explaining that the school where she worked prohibited class boycotts, the woman said, \"I believe that thinking about society and taking action is a form of learning that cannot be obtained through textbooks.\"Many adults in the protest had children in secondary school.One 45-year-old father said he supported the protests but was concerned about children standing in the front lines of the demonstrations because of the risk of injury.(This article was written by Hideshi Nishimoto and Yuichiro Masumitsu.)", "Zara seeks to distance brand from HK protest controversy,REUTERS,September,3,2019": "BEIJING--Spanish apparel giant Zara, seeking to avoid becoming embroiled in controversy over protests in Hong Kong, issued a statement on Chinese social media late on Monday expressing support for China's sovereignty over the Asian financial hub.Zara made its statement after the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao asked in a headline whether the closure of four of the company's Hong Kong shops on Monday was in support of a strike call by students, a question that was seized upon by mainland social media users.Zara, owned by Inditex, said it supported the \"one country, two systems\" policy under which China rules Hong Kong, and had not supported strikes.It was not immediately clear why Zara closed the stores on Monday, as reported by Ming Pao, although shops in Hong Kong have often shut their doors when protests are taking place nearby.Zara did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.The brand became a top trending topic on China's Weibo social media platform, with one hashtag \"Zara statement\" viewed more than 170 million times as of Tuesday morning.On Monday, thousands of Hong Kong university and school students boycotted class and rallied peacefully for democracy, following a weekend marred by some of the worst violence since unrest escalated more than three months ago.Foreign brands are under increasing pressure from Chinese consumers and regulators to fall into line on contentious issues around Chinese sovereignty and its territorial claims.Last month, a number of Chinese brand ambassadors of fashion labels from Coach to Givenchy severed ties with the companies over products which they said violated China's sovereignty by identifying Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries.Last year, Zara was criticized on Chinese social media for placing Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China sees as a break-away province, in a pull-down list of countries on its Chinese website.", "Hong Kong students plan 2nd day of pro-democracy rallies,REUTERS,September,3,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong school and university students on Tuesday are due to boycott classes and hold pro-democracy rallies for the second straight day, further fueling the political crisis in the Chinese-ruled city.Thousands of students joined demonstrations at universities on Monday, many wearing gas masks, joining hands to form human chains and chanting for Hong Kong to be given greater autonomy from the central Chinese government.The runaway rebellion in Hong Kong is piling pressure on its embattled leader Carrie Lam, who was due to hold a media conference at 9:30 a.m. (0130 GMT).Reuters exclusively reported on Tuesday that Lam told business leaders last week that she had caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by igniting the political crisis by introducing a now-suspended extradition bill which would see people sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.Lam said she would quit if she had a choice, according to a leaked audio recording.

The law has been shelved, but Lam has been unable to end the upheaval. Protesters have expanded their demands to include complete withdrawal of the proposal, a concession her administration has so far refused. Large demonstrations wracked the city again over the weekend.Lam suggested that Beijing had not yet reached a turning point. She said Beijing had not imposed any deadline for ending the crisis ahead of National Day celebrations scheduled for October 1. And she said China had \"absolutely no plan\" to deploy People's Liberation Army troops on Hong Kong streets. World leaders have been closely watching whether China will send in the military to quell the protests, as it did a generation ago in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing.Lam noted, however, that she had few options once an issue had been elevated \"to a national level,\" a reference to the leadership in Beijing, \"to a sort of sovereignty and security level, let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented tension between the two big economies in the world.\"In such a situation, she added, \"the room, the political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people's government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited.\"Three people who attended the meeting confirmed that Lam had made the comments in a talk that lasted about half an hour. A 24-minute recording of her remarks was obtained by Reuters. The meeting was one of a number of \"closed-door sessions\" that Lam said she has been doing \"with people from all walks of life\" in Hong Kong.Responding to Reuters, a spokesman for Lam said she attended two events last week that included businesspeople, and that both were effectively private. \"We are therefore not in a position to comment on what the Chief Executive has said at those events,\" the spokesman said.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, a high-level agency under China's cabinet, the State Council, did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters.China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.The Hong Kong protests mark the biggest popular challenge to the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with an escalating strategic rivalry with the United States and a slowing economy. Tensions have risen as the world's two biggest economies are embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war. Disagreements over Taiwan and over China's moves to tighten its control in the South China Sea have further frayed relations between Beijing and Washington.Lam's remarks are consistent with a Reuters report published on Friday that revealed how leaders in Beijing are effectively calling the shots on handling the crisis in Hong Kong. The Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Asked about the report, China's Foreign Ministry said that the central government \"supports, respects and understands\" Lam's decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, denounced it as \"fake.\"As protests escalated, Lam suspended the bill on June 15. Several weeks later, on July 9, she announced that it was \"dead.\" That failed to mollify the protesters, who expanded their demands to include an inquiry into police violence and democratic reform. Many have also called for an end to what they see as meddling by Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong.The tone of Lam's comments in the recording is at odds with her more steely public visage. At times, she can be heard choking up as she reveals the personal impact of the three-month crisis.\"For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,\" she said.Lam told the meeting that the leadership in Beijing was aware of the potential damage to China's reputation that would arise from sending troops into Hong Kong to quell the protests.\"They know that the price would be too huge to pay,\" she said.\"They care about the country's international profile,\" she said. \"It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile and to have some say, not only being a big economy but a responsible big economy, so to forsake all those positive developments is clearly not on their agenda.\"But she said China was \"willing to play long\" to ride out the unrest, even if it meant economic pain for the city, including a drop in tourism and losing out on capital inflows such as initial public offerings.Lam also spoke about the importance of the rule of law in Hong Kong and restoring stability to the city of more than seven million, as well as the need to improve efforts to get the government's message out. At the end, applause can be heard on the recording.While Lam said that now was not the time for \"self-pity,\" she spoke about her profound frustration with not being able \"to reduce the pressure on my frontline police officers,\" or to provide a political solution to \"pacify the large number of peaceful protesters who are so angry with the government, with me in particular.\"Her inability \"to offer a political situation in order to relieve the tension,\" she said, was the source of her \"biggest sadness.\"Lam also spoke about the impact the crisis has had on her daily life.\"Nowadays it is extremely difficult for me to go out,\" she said. \"I have not been on the streets, not in shopping malls, can't go to a hair salon. I can't do anything because my whereabouts will be spread around social media.\"If she were to appear in public, she said, \"you could expect a big crowd of black T-shirts and black-masked young people waiting for me.\" Many of the protesters wear black at demonstrations.After enjoying relatively high popularity in the initial part of her tenure, Lam is now the least popular of any of the four leaders who have run Hong Kong since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, according to veteran pollster Robert Chung, who runs the Public Opinion Research Institute.Lam was chosen as city leader in March 2017, vowing to \"unite society\" and heal divisions in Hong Kong, which remains by far the freest city under Chinese rule. Under the \"one country, two systems\" formula agreed with Britain, Hong Kong enjoys an array of personal freedoms that don't exist in mainland China. One of the most cherished of those freedoms is the city's British-style system of independent courts and rule of law. The protesters say the extradition law would erode that bulwark of liberty.According to a biography on the Hong Kong government website, Lam, a devout Catholic, attended St Francis' Canossian College. Her mother, who took care of seven family members on a daily basis, was her role model and inspiration, the biography said. An election manifesto said Lam came from a \"grassroots\" family and did her homework on a bunk-bed. After studying sociology at the University of Hong Kong, she went on to a distinguished career as a civil servant in Hong Kong. She was elected city leader in March 2017 by a 1,200-member election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists.In her early days as leader, Lam pushed through a series of controversial government policies, drawing public criticism in Hong Kong but winning praise from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.On July 1, 2017, the day she was sworn in, Lam donned a white hard hat as she walked with Xi to inspect the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which physically links Hong Kong to mainland China. Critics say the bridge could further weaken Hong Kong's autonomy by deepening its physical links with southern China.The effective expulsion last year of Financial Times editor Victor Mallet, whose visa wasn't renewed after he hosted an event at the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club with the leader of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, also drew condemnation at home and abroad. Lam and her government later came under fire for banning the party and the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers.Xi praised Lam's leadership during a visit to Beijing in December 2018. \"The central government fully endorses the work of Chief Executive Lam\" and the Hong Kong government, Xi said, according to a report in the state news agency Xinhua.Pollster Robert Chung said Lam's success in pushing through many controversial proposals bolstered her belief she would be able to ram through the extradition bill.\"All these things made her feel so confident, and when we had the first demonstration, she still thought, 'Don't worry, I'll get it through in two days and things will be over,'\" Chung said. \"But she was totally wrong.\"At the meeting last week, Lam said the extradition bill was her doing and was meant to \"plug legal loopholes in Hong Kong's system.\"\"This is not something instructed, coerced by the central government,\" she said.She expressed deep regrets about her push to pass the bill. \"This has proven to be very unwise given the circumstances,\" she said. \"And this huge degree of fear and anxiety amongst people of Hong Kong vis--vis the mainland of China, which we were not sensitive enough to feel and grasp.\"She gave her audience a gloomy outlook. The police, she said, would continue to arrest those responsible for \"this escalating violence,\" a group that the government initially estimated numbered between one thousand and two thousand.It would be \"naive,\" she said, to \"paint you a rosy picture, that things will be fine.\" She did, however, express hope in the city's ultimate \"resurrection.\"\"Hong Kong is not dead yet. Maybe she is very, very sick, but she is not dead yet,\" she said.", "Hong Kong students plan to strike as trains disrupted,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,2,2019": "HONG KONG--On the first day of school Monday, secondary students in Hong Kong supplemented their formal white uniforms with gas masks, goggles and hard hats as they planned to strike in a show of continued commitment to a fiery anti-government protest movement.The semiautonomous Chinese territory has been rocked by nearly three months of pro-democracy protests calling for electoral reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct.The youth-dominated demonstrations will be tested as classes resume and many protesters are expected to go back to school following the summer break. A strike was scheduled for Monday afternoon for student protesters to skip classes and congregate at a public square in central Hong Kong.At St. Francis' Canossian College, a girls' school, uniformed students knelt in a line and held up hand-painted signs that read: \"The five major demands: Not one is dispensable.\"The protesters' demands include dropping charges against demonstrators who have been arrested and formally withdrawing an extradition bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial.Some demonstrators disrupted the morning commute by blocking train doors, attempting to evade riot police who were hot on their heels by moving quickly between multiple public transit stations.Officers at Lok Fu station hit protesters with batons and arrested one. Another three were arrested at Lai King station.On Sunday, the MTR Corp. suspended train service to the airport after several hundred protesters gathered there following calls online to disrupt transportation. They blocked buses arriving at the airport but police in riot helmets kept them out of the terminal.The protesters accuse Beijing and the government of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam of eroding the autonomy and civil liberties promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.", "EDITORIAL: Japan should work toward closing domestic ivory market,editor,September,2,2019": "Despite a new international agreement on the ivory trade that gives some consideration to Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position, the global trend is clearly toward tougher restrictions on the commercial trade of ivory, which is threatening Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elephant population.The Japanese government should make a wholesale review of its policy concerning the issue based on an accurate understanding of the situation.Countries that are parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals, have discussed a proposal to immediately shut down domestic ivory markets submitted by nine African countries fighting ivory poaching.After a week of heated debate on the proposal, the countries settled for a compromise that puts a heavy responsibility on nations with a domestic ivory market to report measures to prevent poaching and illegal trade.While the Japanese government claims its argument has been accepted, there is no denying that the international community is growing more critical of ivory trading.Tokyo clearly needs to take an overdue first step toward a complete ban on the commercial trade of ivory in Japan.Under the CITES, also known as the Washington Convention, international trade in African elephant tusks and other ivory products has been prohibited, in principle, since 1990.In the previous conference of the members of the convention, held in 2016, the countries moved beyond the prohibition on cross-border ivory trade and agreed to ban the sale of ivory within their own borders to help stem the rampant poaching of elephants and illegal ivory trade.In response to the move, China, which was the largest market, ended its domestic production and trade of ivory at the end of 2017.Singapore and Hong Kong have decided to follow suit, accelerating the trend toward closing the internal trade of ivory.Japan still allows trade in ivory it imported before 1989 or accepted exceptional exports from Southern African nations after that.The Japanese government has asserted that the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic market is strictly regulated. It tightened the regulatory control on domestic ivory trade after the previous CITES conference by requiring ivory dealers to register with the authority, switching from the simple requirement that they report their business to the regulator.But many other countries have taken a dim view of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track record concerning the ivory trade. The resolution submitted by the nine African countries billed Japan's ivory market as \"one of the largest in the world\" and argued that loopholes in Japanese regulations have been promoting illegal trade.In fact, an investigation by a nongovernmental organization has pointed out a large amount of ivory being smuggled from Japan to China.Another conservation group has reported that in its secret inquiry of shops dealing in ivory products in Japan, 60 percent of them said ivory products could be taken overseas, which is actually illegal.These findings raise serious doubt about the credibility of Tokyo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim about its regulation of the domestic market.All this is not to say, however, the best way to deal with the problem is to shut down the domestic market as soon as possible.The step would be counterproductive if it leads to a thriving underground market, providing a lucrative source of revenue for organized crimes and other anti-social groups.Closing the market would also negatively affect the craftsmen who use ivory to make seals or Japanese musical instruments and measures would be needed to support them.If Japan wants to allow limited ivory trade for such businesses only as exceptions in order to preserve its traditional culture, it has to build a solid system to ensure rigorous regulation and enforcement and make serious efforts to convince other countries of its effectiveness.Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ivory market has shrunk to one-10th its former size in the past three decades. A growing number of supermarkets and online retailers in Japan are adopting a ban on the sale of ivory.Consumers should also do their share by stopping to think again whether they really need the ivory products they are planning to buy.--The Asahi Shimbun, Aug. 31", "Yen rises, yuan pares losses as Sino-U.S. tariffs kick in,REUTERS,September,2,2019": "The yen strengthened on Monday, thanks to bigger appetites for safe-haven assets as Washington and Beijing put additional tariffs on each other's exports, adding to the gloom hanging over the global economic outlook.Gold, which tends to be bought with the yen during times of economic uncertainty, also rose on Monday by the most in almost a week as investors were drawn to so-called risk-off trades.The offshore yuan initially fell during trading but pared its losses after a private survey on Chinese manufacturing in August beat market expectations.Declines in Asian shares on Monday offered more evidence that traders were steering from risk, which is likely to be an important factor behind currency market swings in coming weeks.\"There are a lot of risk events this week from U.S. and Chinese economic data, which should help us see who is hurting more from the trade war, but we don't think a solution is imminent,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.The yen rose around 0.1 percent versus the dollar to 106.15 in Asian trading.The Japanese currency rose around 0.2 percent to 71.43 versus the Australian dollar and advanced around 0.2 percent to 66.88 per New Zealand dollar.Spot gold rose 0.29 percent to $1,524.05 per ounce.In the onshore Chinese market, the yuan traded at 7.1611 per dollar, versus its previous close of 7.1580.In the offshore market, the yuan initially fell versus the dollar but managed to trim its losses to trade at 7.1686 yuan per dollar, down around 0.1 percent.China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in August as production edged up, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed on Monday, but orders remained weak, suggesting sentiment is likely to remain fragile.The United States slapped 15 percent tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday--including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions--while China imposed new duties on U.S. crude oil.Data coming this week includes a survey on Chinese services and August trade numbers on Sunday. There will be manufacturing and services surveys for the United States, which will also release data on its trade balance and non-farm payrolls.U.S. President Donald Trump said the sides would still meet for talks later this month, but hopes for a resolution to the trade war have diminished.Foreign-exchange trading could be subdued on Monday as U.S. financial markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday.The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed on Monday at 98.821.Risk sentiment could also take a hit due to ongoing protests in Hong Kong over China's rule of the city.Thousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw attention to their fight for democracy.The euro stood at $1.0991, unchanged in Asia, but sentiment for the common currency was weak after it tumbled on Friday to the lowest in more than two years.German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and her coalition partners held off a surge in far right support in two state elections in eastern Germany on Sunday.The result averted an immediate political crisis in Europe's largest economy, but expectations are high that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates at its next monetary policy meeting on Sept. 12, which could weigh on the euro.Sterling traded at $1.2158, down 0.07 percent so far on the day.", "Hong Kong protesters disrupt airport but planes still taking off,REUTERS,September,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Hong Kong airport on Sunday, disrupting travel to draw global attention to their fight for greater democracy for the Chinese-ruled city which facing its biggest political crisis in decades.Passengers continued to enter and leave the terminal freely, as clouds hung low overhead, and planes were still taking off and landing.Black-clad demonstrators targeted the airport three weeks ago, jamming the terminal in sometimes violent clashes with police and prompting some flights to be cancelled or delayed.Trains to the airport were suspended on Sunday as protesters urged the public to overwhelm road links to one of the world's busiest and most efficient airports, built on reclaimed land around a tiny outlying island and reached by a series of bridges.The protesters left the airport in the early evening and thousands were on the road heading for the nearby new town of Tung Chung.\"We plan to disrupt activity at the airport to draw attention to what the government and the police are doing to us,\" said one 20-year-old protester, asking not to be named.\"If we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong.\"Some observers have suggested targeting the airport could lose the protesters public support.Police said protesters hurled iron poles, bricks and rocks on to the railway track near the airport station and trespassed on the track.Sunday's demonstration comes after police and protesters clashed overnight in some of the most intense violence since unrest erupted more than three months ago over concerns Beijing was planning to erode the autonomy granted to the former British colony when it was handed back to China in 1997.China denies the charge of meddling in Hong Kong, which it says is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.Tourist numbers have plummeted in recent weeks and international trade fairs cancelled as the territory faces its first recession in a decade.China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.Several hundred demonstrators also gathered outside the British consulate in central Hong Kong, waving Union Jack flags and chanting \"God save the Queen\".During a chaotic night of violence into the early hours of Sunday, police fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets and protesters threw petrol bombs.As government helicopters hovered overhead, protesters who had been banned from demonstrating set fires in the streets and threw bricks at police near government offices and Chinese military headquarters.Parts of the metro system ground to a halt as skirmishes spread to the subway, with television showing images of people being beaten as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas.Police said they arrested 40 people inside Prince Edward metro station on suspicion of obstructing officers, unlawful assembly and criminal damage. Three stations stayed shut on Sunday.Amnesty International said the metro violence should be investigated.\"Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,\" it said.The latest protests came on the fifth anniversary of China's decision to curtail democratic reforms and rule out universal suffrage in Hong Kong.The unrest began in mid-June, fueled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.But the turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy.Hong Kong returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, such as the right to protest and an independent legal system.The unrest poses the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012, with his government keen to end the protests before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China on Oct 1.", "Hong Kong police storm subway with batons as protests rage,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,September,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters in Hong Kong threw gasoline bombs at government headquarters and set fires in the streets, while police stormed a subway car and hit passengers with batons and pepper spray in scenes that seem certain to inflame tensions further in a city riven by nearly three months of pro-democracy demonstrations.Police had denied permission for a march Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of a decision by China against fully democratic elections in Hong Kong, but protesters took to the streets anyway, as they have all summer. They provoked and obstructed police repeatedly but generally retreated once riot officers moved in, avoiding some of the direct clashes that characterized earlier protests.Late at night, though, video from Hong Kong broadcaster TVB showed police on the platform of Prince Edward subway station swinging batons at passengers who backed into one end of a train car behind umbrellas. The video also shows pepper spray being shot through an open door at a group seated on the floor while one man holds up his hands.It wasn't clear whether all the passengers were protesters. Police said they entered the station to make arrests after protesters assaulted others and damaged property inside. The TVB video was widely shared on social media as another example of police brutality during the protests. Angry crowds gathered outside Prince Edward and nearby Mong Kok station, where police said they made arrests after protesters vandalized the customer service center and damaged ticket machines.Also Saturday, two police officers fired two warning shots into the air \"to protect their own safety\" after being surrounded by protesters near Victoria Park, the government announced. It was the second time police fired warning shots following an incident the previous weekend.Protests erupted in early June in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory of 7.4 million people. A now-shelved China extradition bill brought to the fore simmering concerns about what many in the city see as an erosion of the rights and freedoms that residents are supposed to have under a \"one country, two systems\" framework.The mostly young, black-shirted protesters took over roads and major intersections in shopping districts on Saturday as they rallied and marched with no obvious destination in mind.Authorities closed streets and a subway stop near the Chinese government office and parked water cannon trucks and erected additional barriers nearby, fearing protesters might target the building. The office would have been the endpoint of the march that police did not allow.Instead, a group of hard-line protesters decided to take on police guarding government headquarters from behind large barriers that ring the building to keep demonstrators at bay.While others marched back and forth nearby, a large crowd wearing helmets and gas masks gathered outside. They pointed laser beams at the officers' heads and threw objects over the barriers and at them. Police responded with tear gas, and protesters threw gasoline bombs into the compound.Then came the blue water. A water cannon truck fired regular water, followed by repeated bursts of colored water, staining protesters and nearby journalists and leaving blue puddles in the street.The standoff continued for some time, but protesters started moving back as word spread that police were headed in their direction. A few front-line protesters hurled gasoline bombs at the officers in formation, but there were no major clashes as police cleared the area.Protesters regrouped and blocked a major commercial street by piling up barricades and setting a large fire. Smoke billowed into the air as hundreds of protesters waited on the other side of the makeshift barrier, many pointing laser beams that streaked the night sky above them.Firefighters made their way into the congested area on foot to put out the fire. Police in riot gear removed the barricades and moved in quickly. They could be seen detaining a few protesters, but by then, most had already left.As police advanced east down Hennessey Road, protesters made another stand in the Causeway Bay shopping district. They threw gasoline bombs at police, who fired tear gas and water cannons.Protesters built another fire, a smaller one, in front of Sogo department store. Police waited behind their riot shields while firefighters put out the smoldering fire with extinguishers. When police moved in, the protesters had again retreated.Other groups crossed Hong Kong's harbor to the Tsim Sha Tsui district, where police said they set fires and threw gasoline bombs on Nathan Road.Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said Hong Kong citizens would keep fighting for their rights and freedoms despite the arrests of several prominent activists and lawmakers in the past two days, including activist Joshua Wong.Protesters are demanding the full withdrawal of the extradition bill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China to stand trial \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as democratic elections and an investigation into police use of force.\"I do believe the government deliberately arrested several leaders of the democratic camp to try to threaten Hong Kong people not to come out to fight against the evil law,\" Lam said at what was advertised as a Christian march earlier Saturday.About 1,000 people marched to a Methodist church and police headquarters. They alternated between singing hymns and chanting slogans of the pro-democracy movement. An online flyer for the demonstration called it a \"prayer for sinners\" and featured images of a Christian cross and embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who had proposed the extradition bill.The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of pro-democracy marches that have drawn upward of a million people this summer, canceled its march after failing to win police approval. Police said that while previous marches have started peacefully, they have increasingly degenerated into violence.The standing committee of China's legislature ruled on Aug. 31, 2014, that Hong Kong residents could elect their leader directly, but that the candidates would have to be approved by a nominating committee. The decision failed to satisfy democracy advocates in Hong Kong and led to the 79-day long Occupy Central protests that fall, in which demonstrators camped out on major streets in the financial district and other parts of the city.", "U.S. imposes sanctions on people, firms it says helped N. Korea evade sanctions,REUTERS,September,1,2019": "WASHINGTON--The United States has imposed sanctions on two people and three firms and has identified a blocked ship that it says helped North Korea evade sanctions, the Treasury Department said on Friday.The sanctions target a shipping network that the Treasury Department says engaged in ship-to-ship oil transfers with North Korea to help Pyongyang circumvent sanctions imposed by the United Nations.The Treasury Department says two Taiwan-based individuals used the ship, which had previously conducted at least two ship-to-ship transfers with North Korea-flagged vessels, to transport 1.7 million litres of petroleum products to a North Korean-flagged ship.The two people have interests in the three companies targeted by the sanctions, according to the Treasury Department. Two of the companies are Taiwan-based while a third was located in Hong Kong.Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday that the case was under investigation. In a statement, it urged its citizens and companies not to engage in commercial activities that violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.North Korea is under United Nations sanctions meant to halt Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Although U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly stated he has a good relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the United States seized a North Korean ship earlier this year that Washington said was involved in illegal coal shipments in violation of U.N. sanctions.", "Be like water: Hong Kong protesters meander on the march,REUTERS,August,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands marched in a meandering tour of downtown Hong Kong on Saturday in the pouring rain, the latest in a series of anti-government protests that have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its worst political crisis in decades.Police blocked plans for a mass show of force downtown to mark the fifth anniversary of a decision by China to curtail democratic reforms in the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997.People took to the streets anyway, many joining a \"Christian march\" from the Wanchai entertainment district in a sea of umbrellas, heading to government offices on the lower reaches of the Mid-Levels residential district.Others, many wearing black and face masks, marched in the Causeway Bay shopping district, the latest in a string of protests over three months. Some rallies have turned violent, targeting the airport, the legislature and the Liaison Office, the symbol of Chinese rule.\"Hong Kong has religious freedom,\" Sally Yeung, 27, a Christian, told Reuters. \"We are praying at different check points and praying for justice to arrive in Hong Kong.\"If they prosecute us simply because we are praying, they infringe our religious freedom.\"Hovering under an umbrella outside the government offices, Eric, a 22-year-old student, said, \"Telling us not to protest is like telling us not to breathe. I feel it's my duty to fight for democracy. Maybe we win, maybe we lose. But we fight.\"Police erected water-filled plastic barriers around key government buildings and two water cannon, used briefly for the first time last weekend, were parked near the Liaison Office, which was daubed with graffiti in an earlier protest.The MTR subway suspended some services and shut station exits because of likely \"public activities\".Police arrested a number of prominent pro-democracy activists on Friday, seeking to rein in a movement which started with anger over planned legislation allowing extraditions to mainland China and broadened into calls for democracy amid fears China is squeezing Hong Kong's freedoms.But the latest protests have no leaders. The slogan is \"be like water\", meaning be flexible. Marchers on Saturday were marching here and there, wherever streets took them, communicating with different hand signals and chanting \"stand with Hong Kong\" and \"fight for freedom\".Some said road blocks were forcing marchers to splinter.China denies the charge of meddling in Hong Kong, which it says is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy.Beijing has also accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the demonstrations and warned against foreign interference.There have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force.\"A lot of people from the outside think it is the police who escalate (the violence) first,\" a police officer told a media briefing. \"This is not true.\"An off-duty policeman was attacked late on Friday night by three unidentified men with a knife in the Kwai Chung container port area, suffering wounds to his limbs and back, police said.

He apparently transmitted photos to his brother and to the township chief showing the paramilitary troops massing equipment on the Hong Kong border with mainland China, the agency said.The drills conducted in Shenzhen city fueled speculation that China might use its People's Armed Police to crush repeated mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.Taiwan and China have had frosty relations since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, but most Taiwanese have told government surveys they prefer autonomy.Further straining relations, Taiwanese officials have repeatedly spoken out in favor of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong.China is supposed to inform Taiwan when it detains Taiwanese citizens under an agreement reached in 2009. Taiwanese officials said Friday they had received no information on Lee's case.The township of Fangliao--a fishing community in southern Taiwan--selected Lee in May as a volunteer consultant to help promote its international affairs because he had studied in the United States and worked in a foreign company in Taiwan, said Mayor Archer Chen.Lee, about 40 years old, often travels to China, Chen said.On the morning of Aug. 20, Lee sent Chen photos of the troops along the Hong Kong border, the mayor said. Later that day, Chen said he tried to call Lee but could not get through.\"At first I figured he was out of power or had lost the phone, but after we couldn't reach him for several days I realized things weren't so innocent,\" Chen said.In another recent case, Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che disappeared in March 2017 on a trip to China and surfaced at a court hearing in the southern Chinese city of Changsha in September that year. The activist who had discussed democracy with mainland Chinese on social media was sentenced to five years in prison for his activities.", "Hong Kong activists freed on bail, protest march banned,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong and another core member of a pro-democracy group were granted bail after being charged with inciting people to join a protest in June, while authorities denied permission for a major march Saturday as they took what appears to be a harder line on this summer's protests.The organizers of the march on the fifth anniversary of a decision by China against allowing fully democratic elections for the leader of Hong Kong said they were calling it off after an appeals board denied permission. It was unclear whether some protesters would still demonstrate on their own.The police commander of Hong Kong island, Kwok Pak Chung, appealed to people to stay away from any unauthorized rallies, warning that those caught could face a five-year jail term.He told a daily news conference that he was aware of social media messages urging people to take strolls or hold rallies in the name of religion. Kwok urged the public to \"make a clear break with all acts of violence and stay away from locations where violent clashes may take place.\"Police have been rejecting more applications for rallies and marches, citing violence at or after earlier ones. They also are arresting people for protests earlier this summer, a step they said was a natural development as investigations were completed.Andy Chan, the leader of a pro-independence movement, was arrested at the airport Thursday night under suspicion of rioting and attacking police. Three other protesters were taken in earlier this week for alleged involvement in the storming of the legislative building on July 1, when protesters broke in and vandalized the main chamber.A leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, which had called Saturday's march, said that Hong Kong residents would have to think about other ways to voice their anger if the police keep banning protests.\"The first priority of the Civil Human Rights Front is to make sure that all of the participants who participate in our marches will be physically and legally safe. That's our first priority,\" said Bonnie Leung. \"And because of the decision made by the appeal board, we feel very sorry but we have no choice but to cancel the march.\"Police arrested Wong and Agnes Chow on Friday morning. They were charged with participating in and inciting others to join an unauthorized protest outside a police station on June 21. Wong was also charged with organizing it.\"We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest and prosecute us,\" Wong told reporters outside a courthouse after they were released on bail.Wong, one of the student leaders of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, was released from prison in June after serving a two-month sentence related to that major pro-democracy protest.Wong and Chow, both 22, are members of Demosisto, a group formed by Wong and others in 2016 to advocate self-determination for Hong Kong. Chow tried to run for office last year, but was disqualified because of the group's stance on self-determination. China does not consider independence an option for the semi-autonomous territory.Demosisto is not a leader of this year's movement, which describes itself as \"leaderless,\" though Wong has spoken out regularly in support of the demonstrations.In Washington, President Donald Trump said he thinks the situation in Hong Kong would have been much more violent if not for the U.S. trade war with China.Trump said he sees a connection between Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests and the trade negotiations, and that the talks were \"keeping down the temperature.\" He said that China wants to make a deal \"and they know it puts us in a very bad position if there's not a humane way of handling the problems\" in Hong Kong.China's military deployed fresh troops to Hong Kong on Thursday in what it called a routine rotation amid speculation that it might intervene in the protests.The protests were set off by extradition legislation that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China to face trial and expanded to general concerns that China is chipping away at the rights of Hong Kong residents.The extradition bill was suspended but the protesters want it withdrawn and are also demanding democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions against protesters.Demosisto first reported the arrests of Wong and Chow on its social media accounts, saying Wong was pushed into a private car as he was heading to a subway station around 7:30 a.m. and was taken to police headquarters. It later said Chow had also been arrested, at her home.Chow echoed Wong's comments, saying \"we Hong Kong people won't give up and won't be scared ... we will keep fighting for democracy.\"", "HK activist Joshua Wong arrested in crackdown on protests,REUTERS,August,30,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was arrested on Friday on suspicion of organizing illegal protests as authorities intensify a clampdown on unrest that has plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in more than two decades.Wong, the icon of pro-democracy demonstrations five years ago that foreshadowed the latest turbulence, is the highest-profile arrest since protests escalated in mid-June over fears China was exerting greater control over the city.Two other prominent activists, Andy Chan and Agnes Chow, have also been detained.The bespectacled Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the student-led Umbrella Movement, has not been a prominent figure in current protests, which have no identifiable leaders.He was released from jail in June after serving a five-week term for contempt of court.Police said Wong and Chow, both 22, were arrested on Friday on suspicion of \"organizing unauthorized assembly\" and \"knowingly participating in unauthorized assembly.\"Chan, a founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party that was banned last September, was arrested at Hong Kong's international airport on Thursday on suspicion of \"participating in riots\" and \"attacking police\" during a protest on July 13, police said.Wong's political party Demosisto, which advocates for greater democracy in Hong Kong, said the arrests were an attempt to scapegoat individuals in a movement that has built momentum without public figureheads.\"The arrests were apparently a political operation that makes 'movement leaders' named by the central government,\" Demosisto said on its Facebook page.\"It will only make the government misjudge the public, leading to a deadly situation that is more difficult to resolve.\"Police have refused permission for a pro-democracy march on Saturday and an appeal by organizers to allow the demonstration to proceed was turned down on Friday.The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of previous mass protests, said it would comply with the order and cancel the march but would plan more demonstrations.More than three months of unrest in Hong Kong was sparked by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.It has evolved into calls for greater democracy under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, which guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland that include an independent judiciary, under which Hong Kong has been ruled since 1997.Protesters are riled by perceived interference by China that undermines the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement.Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Lam previously requested Beijing's approval for a plan to ease tensions, evidence of the extent to which China is controlling the Hong Kong government's response to the unrest.Nearly 900 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began with frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have at times fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse activists.With protesters and Hong Kong authorities locked at an impasse, there has been increasing speculation that the government may impose emergency law, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has become a lightning rod for protesters' anger, said this week that the government would consider using \"all laws\" to prevent violence.A senior official with China's parliament told Reuters on Friday that Hong Kong was a long way from having to declare emergency powers.China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the demonstrations in the former British colony and warned against foreign governments interfering in the city's protests.A photograph in a pro-Beijing newspaper earlier this month of Wong meeting a U.S. consular official triggered a war of words between Washington and Beijing.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus called China a \"thuggish regime\" for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat.China brought fresh troops into Hong Kong on Thursday in what it described as a routine rotation of its garrison there.Chinese state media stressed the troop movement was routine and Asian and Western diplomats watching the People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces in the territory had been expecting it.The Civil Human Rights Front leader, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by two men armed with a knife and a baseball bat on Thursday, it said on its Facebook page. He was not hurt but a friend who tried to protect him suffered injuries to his arm.\"The repeated harassment of pro-democracy activists, combined with police bans on demonstrations, has created a climate of fear for peaceful protesters,\" Amnesty International said in a statement.This weekend marks five years since Beijing ruled out universal suffrage for Hong Kong and comes as the financial hub faces its first recession in a decade, with all its pillars of growth under stress.", "Yen backpedals on hopes of easing U.S.-China trade tensions,REUTERS,August,30,2019": "The dollar held firm against the yen on Friday, as comments from Beijing sparked renewed hopes that China and the United States could get full-fledged negotiations back on track to resolve their protracted trade dispute.The U.S. currency was also supported by investors' month-end rebalancing needs, which has helped lift the dollar index to its highest level in a month.The dollar index rose to as high as 98.554 on Thursday, a top last seen on Aug. 1, and last stood at 98.439.Against the yen, the greenback traded at 106.53 yen, flat from late U.S. levels and up 1.1 percent on the week.China's commerce ministry said on Thursday Beijing and Washington were discussing the next round of face-to-face talks scheduled for September.U.S. President Donald Trump said some discussions were taking place on Thursday, ahead of a looming deadline for additional U.S. tariffs on Sept. 1.The signs of talks were enough to mitigate worries about a further escalation in bilateral tensions, which intensified last week after both countries imposed additional tariffs on each other's goods late last week.Yet, political risks from the U.K. to Hong Kong and the Middle East added to the risks for the global economy and kept many investors on edge.Despite the dollar's latest rebound against the yen, the U.S. currency is still down 2.1 percent on the month.\"There are so many geopolitical risk factors now.

The last U.S. Navy ship to visit Qingdao was the destroyer Benfold in 2016.Asked why the U.S. request was denied, the U.S. defense official said the question should be directed to Beijing. China's Defense Ministry, however, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A trade war between the world's two largest economies has damaged global growth and raised market fears that the world economy could tip into recession.But, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday raised hopes for a deal that could de-escalate the tariff war.Earlier this month, China denied a request by the U.S. Navy transport dock ship Green Bay and guided-missile cruiser Lake Erie to visit Hong Kong.

The broad sell-off sent the S&P 500 to its fourth straight weekly loss.The tumbling began after Trump responded angrily on Twitter following China's announcement of new tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods. In one of his tweets he \"hereby ordered\" U.S. companies with operations in China to consider moving them to other countries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the U.S.Trump also said he'd respond directly to the tariffs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and after the market closed he delivered, announcing that the U.S. would increase existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, and that new tariffs on another $300 billion of imports would be 15% instead of 10%.The ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, and especially its unpredictability, is certain to have damaging effects on Asia. The unpredictability affects the real decisions central banks make on fiscal policy and companies make on their strategies and investments, setting off ripples of uncertainty.Zhu Huani of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said that what he called Trump's \"tariff tantrum\" was setting off \"the sense that tariffs could continue to rise,\" with the \"the unpredictability of timing and extent of these trade actions risk accentuating the paralysis of business decisions and big-ticket business spending.\"\"No matter which way you cut the cake, it is nearly impossible to construct a bullish, or even neutral scenario for equity markets today,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.Trump also said Friday morning that he was \"ordering\" UPS, Federal Express and Amazon to block any deliveries from China of the powerful opioid drug fentanyl.

The yuan has lost 6.5% from this year's high on Feb. 28.Chinese leaders have promised to avoid \"competitive devaluation\" to hold down export prices in the face of Trump's tariff hikes. But regulators are trying to make the state-set exchange rate more market oriented. That allows investor jitters about the tariff war to push the yuan lower.Trump announced more tariff increases Friday on Chinese goods and said he was ordering American companies to stop dealing with China. He said later he was threatening to use emergency powers under a 1977 law that targets rogue regimes, terrorists and drug traffickers.That came after Beijing announced tariff hikes on $75 billion of American imports in retaliation for earlier U.S. increases.\"This tit-for-tat escalation shows how unlikely a trade deal and de-escalation have become,\" said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.Chinese have hardened their position, especially after Trump imposed curbs in May on technology sales to telecom equipment giant Huawei, China's first global tech brand.\"It does not appear likely they will yield in the face of more economic pressure,\" said UBS economists Tao Wang, Ning Zhang and Jennifer Zhong in a report.A weaker yuan would help Chinese exporters cope with U.S. hikes tariffs. But it also would hurt China by making it costlier for real estate developers and others to repay billions of dollars in foreign debt.Trump said Friday he would raise planned tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 15%. The U.S. Trade Representative said tariffs already imposed on another $250 billion in Chinese imports would rise from 25% to 30% on Oct. 1 following a public comment period.That was in response to Beijing's announcement of tariff increases on $75 billion of American imports. The government said it also would go ahead with penalties on imports of U.S.-made autos and auto parts that were announced last year but suspended while the two sides negotiated.The Chinese government said those increases would take effect in two batches on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. That matches the timeline for Trump's plan to extend tariff hikes to $300 billion of Chinese imports.The latest U.S. tariff hikes are \"based on irrational arrogance and enthusiasm,\" the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Sunday.Chinese government spokespeople have appealed to Washington to reach a compromise to end the dispute that threatens to tip the global economy into recession. That came after Trump warned Americans might need to endure economic pain to get long-term results.Negotiators met last month in Shanghai and are due to meet next month in Washington. But they have given no sign of progress.The two sides are deadlocked over how to enforce any deal. China insists Trump's punitive tariffs must be lifted as soon as a deal takes effect. Washington says at least some must stay to make sure Beijing keeps any promises it makes.Chinese exporters have been battered by a plunge in sales to the United States, their biggest and richest foreign market. But communist leaders are resisting pressure to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technologies.Europe and Japan echo U.S. complaints that Beijing's industrial plans violate its market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Some American officials worry they might erode U.S. industrial leadership.The weakness of the yuan, also known as the renminbi, or \"people's money,\" is among U.S. grievances against Beijing. American officials complain a weak yuan gives Chinese exporters an unfair price edge in foreign markets and helps swell the massive U.S. trade deficit with China.China's central bank sets the exchange rate each morning and allows the yuan to fluctuate by 2% against the dollar during the day. The central bank can buy or sell currency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or order commercial banks to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to dampen price movements.The People's Bank of China allowed the yuan to fall past the politically sensitive level of seven to the dollar early this month. Previously, economists had expected the central bank to put a floor under the currency at that level to avoid spooking financial markets.", "Extinction bites: Countries agree to protect sharks and rays,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,26,2019": "GENEVA--Countries have agreed to protect more than a dozen shark species at risk of extinction, in a move aimed at conserving some of the ocean's most awe-inspiring creatures who have themselves become prey to commercial fishing and the Chinese appetite for shark fin soup.Three proposals covering the international trade of 18 types of mako sharks, wedgefishes and guitarfishes each passed with a needed two-thirds majority in a committee of the World Wildlife Conference known as CITES on Sunday.\"Today we are one step closer to protecting the fastest shark in the ocean, as well as the most threatened,\" said Jen Sawada, who directs The Pew Charitable Trusts' shark conservation work. The measures don't ban fishing these sharks and rays, but any trade must be sustainable.The move isn't final but is a key sign before an official decision at its plenary this coming week.Conservationists applauded and exchanged hugs after the tallies. Opponents variously included China, Iceland, Japan, Malaysia and New Zealand. The United States voted against the mako shark measure, but supported the other two.Critics variously argued that the measures distanced CITES from its initial mandate to protect endangered land animals and plants, not marine life, and insisted the science didn't back up the call to increase protections. They also noted that that millions of Mako sharks exist and even the CITES secretariat advised against the protections.But proponents countered that stocks of sharks are in a deep dive, with tens of millions killed each year, and that measures need to be taken now--with what they call some of the most significant rules ever adopted for trade in shark parts.Rima Jabado, a shark expert and lead scientist of the Gulf Elasmo project, said many of the species included in the CITES proposals are classified as \"critically endangered.\" Jabado said there has been an 80 percent decline in the number of wedgefishes, based on available data. Like giant guitarfishes, the enigmatic wedgefish has an elongated triangle-shaped head and can be found in oceans in Southeast Asia, the Arabian Sea and East Africa.Makos are the world's fastest sharks, reaching speeds of up to 130 kph. But they often get caught up in the nets of fishing trawlers hunting for tuna.Several countries with large fishing fleets, including Japan, opposed the measure to protect mako sharks.\"Japan has been highly dependent on (live) marine resources from the ancient times,\" said Hideki Moronuki, director of fisheries negotiations at the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. \"It's very, very important for us in Japan to sustainably use all those marine riches,\" he said. He was among those who noted that even the CITES secretariat had recommended rejecting the mako shark proposal.CITES concluded that \"with the possible but uncertain exception of the Mediterranean, the population of (mako sharks) does not seem to have declined below the 30 percent threshold in different ocean regions\" and that \"it is currently not projected that declines would continue.\"Still, Jabado said some species of sharks and rays are becoming so difficult to find in the wild that scientists only often see them when they are on sale at local fish markets.\"How are we ever going to save these species if we only see them when fishermen bring them in?\" she said, adding that even if actions are taken now, it will be decades before shark populations start to recover. Losing more sharks and rays could also have other unintended consequences since they are top ocean predators and help to balance the ecosystems, Jabado said.Scientists warn that although warming oceans and climate change are also hurting sharks, it is the demand for shark fin soup that is threatening to drive some species to extinction. The Pew Trust estimates that between 63 million and 273 million sharks are killed every year, mostly to feed the shark fin trade centered in Hong Kong.Dried shark fin can draw up to $1,000 per kilogram. The fins are often turned into shark fin soup, a Chinese delicacy that symbolizes good fortune, in which the gelatinous fin is served in a broth whose recipe dates back to the 10th-century Song Dynasty. Fishermen often slice off a shark's fin while the animal is still alive before tossing the writhing carcass back into the ocean.While Chinese celebrities like retired basketball star Yao Ming are trying to persuade diners to abandon the soup, many aren't convinced.\"Shark fin soup is a Chinese tradition so why should I stop eating it?\" Wilson Kwan said outside a seafood restaurant in London's Chinatown. \"I know some people say it's cruel to sharks, but sharks are killers too.\"Last year, there were an estimated 66 unprovoked shark attacks on humans globally, including four fatalities, according to the Florida Museum, which tracks such incidents. It is exceedingly rare for sharks to bite humans--and when they do, it's often because they have mistaken them for seals or other prey.Conservationists say movies like \"Jaws\" have unfairly maligned society's perception of sharks and in turn, made it difficult to garner support to protect them.\"People would be outraged if they were serving dolphins in restaurants,\" said Graham Buckingham of the British shark group, Bite-Back. \"But because it's a shark, they think it's perfectly OK.\"", "Hong Kong police draw guns, arrest 36 after latest protest,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,26,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police drew their guns and fired a warning shot after protesters attacked officers with sticks and rods, and brought out water cannon trucks for the first time, in an escalation in the summer-long protests that have shaken the city's government and residents.Sunday's main showdown took place on a major drag in the outlying Tsuen Wan district following a protest march that ended in a nearby park. While a large crowd rallied in the park, a group of hard-line protesters took over a main street, strewing bamboo poles on the pavement and lining up orange and white traffic barriers and cones to obstruct police.After hoisting warning flags, police used tear gas to try to disperse the crowd. Protesters responded by throwing bricks and gasoline bombs toward the police. The result was a surreal scene of small fires and scattered paving bricks on the street between the two sides, rising clouds of tear gas and green and blue laser lights pointed by the protesters at the police.The protesters eventually decided to abandon their position. Two water cannon trucks and a phalanx of police vehicles with flashing lights joined riot police on foot as they advanced up the street. They met little resistance. Television footage showed a water cannon being fired once, but perhaps more as a test, as it didn't appear to reach the retreating protesters.Officers pulled their guns after a group of remaining protesters chased them down a street with sticks and rods, calling them \"gangsters.\" The officers held up their shields to defend themselves as they retreated. Police said that one officer fell to the ground and six drew their pistols after they were surrounded, with one firing the warning shot.Some protesters said they're resorting to violence because the government has not responded to their peaceful demonstrations.\"The escalation you're seeing now is just a product of our government's indifference toward the people of Hong Kong,\" said Rory Wong, who was at the showdown after the march.One neighborhood resident, Dong Wong, complained about the tear gas.\"I live on the 15th floor and I can even smell it at home,\" he said. \"I have four dogs, sneezing, sneezing all day. ... The protesters didn't do anything, they just blocked the road to protect themselves.\"Police said they arrested 36 people, including a 12-year-old, for offenses such as unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon and assaulting police officers.Earlier Sunday, tens of thousands of umbrella-carrying protesters marched in the rain. Many filled Tsuen Wan Park, the endpoint of the rally, chanting, \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\" the South China Morning Post newspaper reported.The march in Hong Kong's New Territories started near the Kwai Fong train station, which has become a focal point for protesters after police used tear gas there earlier this month. Police with riot gear could be seen moving into position along the march route.Protesters have taken to the semiautonomous Chinese territory's streets for more than two months. Their demands include democratic elections and an investigation into police use of force to quell the protests.A large group clashed with police on Saturday after a march in the Kowloon Bay neighborhood, building barricades and setting fires in the streets. Police said they arrested 29 people for various offenses, including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting police officers.The clashes, while not as prolonged or violent as some earlier ones, ended a brief lull in the violence. The protests, which began in early June, had turned largely peaceful the previous weekend, after weeks of escalating violence.In nearby Macao, another Chinese territory, a pro-Beijing committee chose a businessman as the gambling hub's next leader with little of the controversy surrounding the government in Hong Kong.Ho Iat-seng, running unopposed, will succeed current leader Chui Sai-on in December.

Organizers hoped the chains, which traced three subway routes, would total 40 kilometers in length.It was the latest protest in a nearly 11-week-old movement that began with calls to scrap a now-suspended extradition bill and has widened to include demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality at protests.\"It actually enraged me, the way that the government, the (city's) chief executive and then the police, how they carry out their jobs,\" said Michael Ng, who works in finance and joined the chain outside an upscale mall. \"Very brutal, I would say.

The Global Times, a Communist Party-owned tabloid newspaper, reported that Chen had been detained for soliciting prostitutes.China often uses public order charges against political targets and has sometimes used the charge of soliciting prostitution. Ou Shaokun, an anti-corruption activist, alleged in 2015 that he was framed by authorities in southern Hunan province who said they found him in a hotel room with a prostitute.The accountants march drew a few thousand participants who gathered in a city square before heading to government headquarters. They were the latest profession to back the movement publicly following rallies by lawyers, teachers and medical workers.One participant, Sarah Wong, said accountants are usually quiet because they are focused on getting the numbers right, but they cannot remain silent anymore.Kenneth Leung, a lawmaker who represents the accounting industry, said that the extradition bill would have affected accountants, because many of them have clients in mainland China and travel there. The legislation would have allowed suspects to be extradited to the mainland to face trial.\"The profession as a whole needs to come out to express their concerns and grievances,\" he said.Rebecca Sy, the Cathay Dragon union head, told a news conference that the Hong Kong airline had dismissed her without giving a reason, but that the firing came after she was pulled from a flight and asked by an airline representative to confirm that screenshots from Facebook were from her account.\"It's not just about the termination of the job, it's also the whole issue, it's terrifying.

But he stopped short of identifying the origin of the channels.Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. on Monday said that channels they had removed had engaged in a state-backed effort by China to undermine the protests in Hong Kong through posts calling participants dangerous and vile extremists.The protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.\"We are deeply concerned by Chinese attempts to manipulate public opinion by spreading disinformation about the situation in Hong Kong,\" a United States State Department spokeswoman told Reuters.In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on YouTube's decision, but said the Chinese people's greatest wish was for the chaos and violence to end in Hong Kong.\"The will of 1.4 billion people cannot be blocked or controlled, and of course cannot be shut out,\" he told reporters.The Chinese mission to the United Nations sent Reuters a link to a story from the ruling Communist Party media outlet People's Daily that said Twitter and Facebook \"abused media freedom\" in cracking down on accounts that had revealed violence in the protests.Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are all blocked in mainland China by the government but are available in Hong Kong. Each of the services bans deceptive practices and inauthentic accounts.The three companies have also come under fire from users for generating revenue and supporting state media and officials in China.Several social media users in Hong Kong have posted screenshots over the last two weeks that they said showed anti-protest advertising from outlets such as China Central Television, or CCTV, appearing on Twitter and YouTube. The ads criticized the Hong Kong protesters.In response, Twitter said Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media, a change that had been in the works for months.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said \"we continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media.\"YouTube said it did not plan to change its ads policies. But YouTube told Reuters that it would soon be expanding its labeling of state-backed media outlets in the region.YouTube places a disclaimer on its services from government-funded networks around the world, including Chinese broadcasters Xinhua, CCTV and CGTN, but it does not yet include the label for Chinese newspapers People's Daily, China Daily and Global Times, Reuters found on Wednesday.Social media companies long have courted closer relationships with news outlets and politicians around the world, hoping that getting them to post on their services would in turn attract more users. But relationships with governments such as China, which regularly faces criticism of its human rights record, have drawn scrutiny from users and lawmakers in the United States.Facebook's Stone confirmed the company has conducted training in China for government and state media personnel.\"We provide a standard set of guidance and best practice training to groups around the world including governments, political parties, media outlets, and nonprofits so they can manage their Facebook Pages,\" he said.Twitter and YouTube did not immediately respond to questions about their support and training for state media outlets, but Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that Twitter has trained Chinese officials on how to use its tools.", "Hong Kong unions urge Cathay Pacific to end \u00e2\u0080\u0098white terror\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,August,23,2019": "HONG KONG--Cathay Pacific Airways, which is caught in the crosswinds between authorities in Beijing and anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, must put an end to \"all forms of white terror,\" trade unions in the Chinese-ruled city said on Friday.The carrier has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, the demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) called a news conference after the sudden dismissal of Rebecca Sy, the head of Cathay Dragon's Airlines Flight Attendants' Association, after a 17-year career.Sy said she was fired, without explanation, after managers saw and confirmed her Facebook account. HKCTU said 14 people have been fired so far over the protests, and called Sy's dismissal a \"blatant act of suppression.\"\"All the employees are being frightened, not just cabin crews, but even the management,\" Sy said. \"My colleagues are all terrified because of its white terror.\"White terror is a common expression to describe anonymous acts that create a climate of fear.Cathay Pacific did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of the airline were down more than 1 percent, lagging a 0.6 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.Sy's departure, which Cathay confirmed on Friday, follows last week's shock resignation of Chief Executive Rupert Hogg, the highest-profile corporate casualty of the unrest.Cathay pilots and cabin crew have described a campaign of political denunciations, sackings and telephone searches by Chinese aviation officials.Recent weeks have been extremely challenging for its employees, the Hong Kong carrier, which is 30 percent owned by Air China, said ahead of Friday's news conference.\"We thank all our dedicated staff who are committed to serving our customers in a professional manner,\" said James Tong, its director of corporate affairs.The demonstrations, which have occasionally shut the airport and businesses in the Asian financial hub, still have broad support, despite some violent clashes between police and protesters.HKCTU said \"white terror\" loomed for the entire aviation industry, and demanded that Sy be immediately reinstated.Walking a tightrope between the protests and political masters in Beijing, many Hong Kong firms are opting to toe the Communist Party line to avoid potential repercussions following the experience of Cathay Pacific Airways.", "Mixed reaction as Yokohama bets on hosting casino resort,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,August,23,2019": "Yokohama on Aug. 22 officially declared itself a player to land one of the three casino-based resort locations that the central government has proposed, pitching a prime bayfront location.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have developed a strong sense of crisis regarding the future of Yokohama,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mayor Fumiko Hayashi said at a regularly scheduled news conference, where she announced the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to seek hosting a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cintegrated resort\u00e2\u0080\u009d (IR).Hayashi listed some of the problems that Yokohama is facing: a population decline after peaking in 2019; a strain in the city's financial condition; a lack of overnight stays by visitors; and the low amount spent per visitor.An integrated resort that will come with an international conference hall, hotel and casino, among other attractions, is a solution to these problems, the mayor said.With Yokohama being the most populated incorporated city and the first municipality in the Tokyo metropolitan area to enter the bidding, the announcement was greeted enthusiastically by chamber officials and the casino industry, and with anxiety from rival municipalities.It also ignited strong opposition and protests from residents concerned of the negative impact that a casino could bring, such as gambling addiction and increased crime.However, Hayashi emphasized that an IR offers many advantages. Upon its completion, a casino-based resort would have an economic ripple effect of about 1 trillion yen ($9.3 billion), and the city would enjoy an increase in tax revenues estimated at about 100 billion yen annually, she said.The candidate site will be Yokohama Port\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yamashita Wharf, which covers 47 hectares of land and is convenient from central Tokyo and Haneda Airport.If selected, the city aims for the opening of the IR in the latter half of the 2020s.The city government will submit an IR-related supplementary budget plan of 260 million yen to a regular session of the city assembly that will start from Sept. 2.The budget will cover research and analysis by experts and a survey on actual cases of gambling addiction.Hayashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formal announcement instantly spurred a political backlash and public protest, due to her previous \u00e2\u0080\u009cundecided\u00e2\u0080\u009d stance on the issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009c(The mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision) is nothing less than a deceptive attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tomoko Abe, a Lower House member who heads the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kanagawa prefectural chapter.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf an IR is as wonderful as she says, then she should seek the people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will in an election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abe said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to do it sneakily.

In 2014, during her second mayoral term, Hayashi launched a project to consider a plan of seeking an IR to locate in Yokohama.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need more facilities that will have an impact in Yokohama,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at the time.However, as the mayoral election approached in 2017, in which her rival candidates opposed an IR in Yokohama, Hayashi changed her position to one of noncommittal.But since the law to set up IRs passed the Diet in July 2018, Hayashi has laid the groundwork for a bid by her city, by collecting proposals for an IR from private companies and hosting explanatory meetings for residents.Asked by reporters why she changed her previous undecided stance, Hayashi said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that I would never invite an IR.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that she never abandoned her desire to (bring in an IR),\u00e2\u0080\u009d one veteran city assembly member of the Liberal Democratic Party said in an analysis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe just toned it down because there was a mayoral election.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Yokohama Chamber of Commerce and Industry has urged the city to enter the race to land one of the three IR locations.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will actively support (the city) and work together cooperatively to realize the invitation of an IR,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chamber said in a statement issued after the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement.Not everyone was happy with the news.A citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group that opposes a casino-based resort in Yokohama held a news conference on the day and announced that it will discuss a plan to recall the mayor.Inside the city hall, dozens of residents and assembly members who are not affiliated with a party got into scuffles with security guards and city employees.They wrestled in an attempt to directly hand a petition signed by residents opposing an IR and position documents to the mayor.Kazumi Kobayashi, a vice mayor of Yokohama, appeared and accepted them. But the protest continued for about two hours.Yokohama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision also immediately sparked positive reactions and actions from companies hoping to set up a casino-based resort in Yokohama.Las Vegas Sands Corp., the U.S.-based largest developer and operator of luxury IRs, whose properties include Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and The Venetian Las Vegas, stated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will concentrate our efforts on development opportunities in Tokyo and Yokohama.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe central government plans to permit establishment of IRs for up to three locations.

Young people set up tents as first-aid and battery-charging stations, while older demonstrators of their parents' generation supplied them with drinking water and face masks.There also were roadside \"study tents\" where I met high school students doing their math homework. These teens told me they wished to participate in the movement, even if only for a short time.According to a colleague of mine who is reporting on the current protests in Hong Kong, young people in their teens and 20s appear to be dominating the scene again, as they did five years ago.When someone tells them of an approaching ambulance, they immediately make way for the vehicle. And even on the day they broke into Hong Kong's legislature, they reportedly practiced considerable restraint, reminding one another to refrain from acts of destruction.Now that I am following the developments from Japan, I am deeply disappointed by news of recent air traffic disruptions due to the protesters' occupation of Hong Kong's international airport, as well as reports of occasional outbreaks of violence.But even so, I understand that the demonstrators this time are not resorting to any long-term siege with pitched tents to cut off road networks.The people of Hong Kong have probably learned their lesson from the Umbrella Movement, which caused them fatigue and only proved to be a waste of time.When demonstrators lose restraint, they immediately lose the support of the public. And once that happens, the authorities move in immediately for a crackdown.Lu Xun (1881-1936) famously said the following: \"The earth has no roads to begin with. But when many people pass one way, a road is made.\"I remember these words, written in large letters on a banner carried by Hong Kong demonstrators five years ago.Next week, the current protests will exceed the 79-day duration of the Umbrella Movement.

Recently, the 17-year-old also started describing herself as a patriot who supports China's stance on Hong Kong.The high school student from Shanghai is among the Chinese citizens who in recent weeks have flocked to Western social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter to criticize demonstrators in the former British colony.She is part of a growing offensive emerging from China in recent days aimed at promoting Beijing's narrative about what is happening in Hong Kong to an overseas audience. State media outlets, Chinese celebrities and regular Internet users have all banded together behind the effort.While little news or video footage of the Hong Kong protests made its way into mainland China in the early weeks, the subject now dominates the news and most-read topic lists on China's Twitter-like Weibo, with calls for Chinese citizens to take action to \"protect Hong Kong.\"China's government-owned media outlets have flooded Internet platforms both inside and outside the country with stories and images portraying the Hong Kong protests as the work of \"terrorists\" manipulated by Western powers and \"radical forces.\"They have paid to promote their coverage of Hong Kong on sites including Twitter and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland. The companies said Tuesday that the Chinese government has also mounted a propaganda campaign using fake accounts, thousands of which were taken down in recent days.The efforts have unleashed an unusual dynamic in which mainland citizens who are normally subject to strict controls on their online behavior have been using virtual private networks to bypass the \"Great Firewall\" and spread anti-protest messages internationally, as well as on Chinese social media sites.\"It's only really the hypernationalists that are given free rein, their content isn't censored,\" said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\"They're allowed to conduct campaigns, they're able to organize online ... so that happens in China within the Great Firewall, and then we see also it spill out into the wider Internet,\" he said.But analysts say it's unclear who Beijing is targeting with the campaign, or what the impact has been.Lee Foster, an intelligence analyst at U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the fake account campaigns on Twitter and Facebook were \"relatively unsophisticated.\"\"(It's) not too dissimilar we've seen from Russia about 4-5 years ago in terms of very simplistic personas and the use of identical messaging across accounts,\" he said.King-wa Fu, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Center, said he suspected the impact within Hong Kong was minimal.\"The majority of Hong Kong consume local media content,\" he said.The Hong Kong demonstrations began almost three months ago as a protest against a new extradition law and have since snowballed into a broader movement to defend the city-state's civil liberties in the face of what is perceived to be tightening mainland control.Wang said she and her group of online peers, also known as \"fan girls\" or \"fanquan girls,\" began to campaign against the protests after her idol Zhang, a member of South Korean boy band Exo, joined other Chinese celebrities last week to say that he backed the Hong Kong police and Beijing's territorial sovereignty.\"Since our big brother loves our country so much, we fans have to support him,\" she told Reuters. \"So I went on Instagram to post messages such as 'Hong Kong is part of China,' 'Reject violence' and 'Hong Kong police are the best!'\"They were joined by other Internet denizens such as those on \"Di Bar,\" a discussion forum that is part of search engine giant Baidu's platform, where calls went out to the group's 31.3 million members asking them to flood overseas social media platforms with similar slogans and posts.The Internet movements were endorsed by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday on its nightly news program, one of China's most-watched shows.\"These days, from fanquan girls to Di Bar, netizens to overseas students, all the forces which love Hong Kong and China have united to support and safeguard the city,\" said newscaster Gang Qiang.State television's English-language channel CGTN, the official Xinhua news agency and the Communist Party's People's Daily have all taken to Twitter and Facebook with gusto, denouncing the protesters and putting out Beijing's voice.\"What must be hidden and has to flee is not good, but evil,\" CGTN said in a tweet on Wednesday that was accompanied by a video of masked protesters with captions saying they wanted to hide their identities to avoid retribution.Xinhua and CGTN paid to promote their Hong Kong coverage, according to Twitter's Ads Transparency Center. Neither outlet responded to requests for comment.Twitter told Reuters on Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media.China denounced the moves by Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday, saying it had a right to put out its own views.China's foreign ministry on Tuesday also sent a letter accompanied by a 42-page document to foreign media outlets including Reuters, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal outlining Beijing's stance on the events in Hong Kong.The documents included a timeline of how the protests began, saying that Hong Kong's opposition and some \"radical forces\" had used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests, as well as articles which it said pointed to links between \"foreign forces\" and protesters.", "Hong Kong police in standoff with protesters after sit-in,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,22,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong riot police faced off briefly with protesters occupying a suburban train station Wednesday evening following a commemoration of a violent attack there by masked assailants against supporters of the anti-government movement.Near the end of the event, the police began what they called a \"dispersal operation, using minimum force\" after some protesters blocked roads and flashed laser pointers at officers.Police with riot shields faced off at the station entrance against a group of remaining protesters, who sprayed a firehose and spread soap on the floor to slow a police approach, while piling up trash bins, a wheelchair and umbrellas in a makeshift blockade.They also discharged fire extinguishers, creating a cloud obscuring visibility. The station's entrance shutters were lowered, barricading the protesters inside.The confrontation ended without further incident, as police retreated and protesters left on trains.The black-clad protesters flooded earlier into Yuen Long station to commemorate the July 21 rampage by a group of men suspected of organized crime links, in what was a shocking escalation of the city's summer of protest.The protesters observed a moment of silence, then covered their right eyes, a reference to a woman who reportedly suffered a severe eye injury from a police projectile.Many sat on the station floor, while others walked slowly around the concourse in a protest march.Chanting \"Liberate Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our times,\" they also drew attention to what they say is the lack of progress by police in investigating the attack, which left both protesters and bystanders injured. Protesters have accused the police of colluding with the attackers by delaying their response, but authorities have denied it.Police say they have arrested 28 people in connection with the attack but haven't charged anyone yet. They say some of those arrested have triad links, referring to organized crime syndicates.The anti-government protests began more than two months ago and have spiraled into a political crisis, with supporters demanding full democracy and an investigation into alleged police brutality.The Yuen Long attack came after a massive protest was winding down in July. The assailants, all clad in white in contrast to the protesters' black, swung wooden poles and steel rods, injuring 45 people.Also Wednesday, China said a staffer at the British consulate in Hong Kong has been given 15 days of administrative detention in the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen for violating regulations on public order.The case is stoking fears that Beijing is extending its judicial reach to semiautonomous Hong Kong.\"The relevant employee is a Hong Kong resident, not a British citizen,\" so the case is \"purely the internal affairs of China,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing.A small group of supporters gathered outside the British consulate to demand the U.K. government step up efforts to secure the release of the man, Simon Cheng Man-kit, chanting \"Save Simon now!\"Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China brooked no foreign interference in Hong Kong but understood foreign countries' concerns about the safety of their citizens and investments and was determined to maintain the territory's stability and prosperity under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, which gives Hong Kong wide autonomy.\"We believe the government of the special administrative region can maintain (foreign nationals') proper legal rights.

Protesters at the subway station on Wednesday were angry that nobody has yet been prosecuted for that violence.The standoff stopped short of recent intense clashes with police, who refrained from using tear gas or attempting to storm protesters' lines. Only one rock was seen hitting a police shield and most protesters headed home before midnight.Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial but have since grown into one of the biggest populist challenges faced by Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.The unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the \"one country, two systems\" formula adopted after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 but not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.A flurry of anti-government demonstrations are planned in coming weeks, including a rally by students on Thursday and another strike in districts across the city in early September.Continuing protests could deepen the impact on the city's economy, especially small and medium enterprises, Bank of East Asia warned on Wednesday after reporting a 75 percent plunge in its first-half net profit due to loan writedowns in mainland China.The protests are already exacting a toll on Hong Kong's economy and tourism, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.Standard Chartered said in Thursday's advertisements the bank supported the special administrative region's government to uphold social order and \"guard the status of Hong Kong as an international financial center.\"HSBC said all parties must resolve disagreement through communication rather than violence. Neither HSBC nor Bank of East Asia referred to the government in their advertisements.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reiterated on Tuesday that the extradition legislation was dead but has stopped short of withdrawing the bill, as protesters have demanded.Demonstrators are also calling for an independent inquiry, a halt to descriptions of the protests as \"rioting,\" a waiver of charges against those arrested and resumption of political reform.Protests in recent weeks, which have at times drawn more than a million people onto the streets, have also included the storming of the legislature and major disruptions and violence at the airport.Beijing has reacted sharply and has accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest. China has also sent clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighboring Shenzhen.China confirmed on Wednesday that a Chinese national working at Britain's Hong Kong consulate has been detained in Shenzhen for violating the law, likely worsening already strained ties between Beijing and London.Britain has said it is \"extremely concerned\" by reports that staff member Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9.

What does her disappearance from the spotlight reveal about the scandal-ridden entertainment industry in this country, known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeinokai\u00e2\u0080\u009d?Atsushi Fukuda, president of consulting firm Speedy Inc., which Non has a contract with, spoke with The Asahi Shimbun about the intense pressure she faced and warned of the dark side of the entertainment world.Excerpts from the interview follow:Therefore, as far as I know, she is one of the highest paid actors or actresses in Japan.Non is the only talent our company manages. That means, we are in a position in which we can speak freely against the entertainment industry.I started working at a commercial production company after graduating from university. When I was in my 30s, I joined a Hollywood film company and developed a business that resulted in the launch of a TV station as well as Animax Broadcast Japan and AXN Japan Inc.

Estimates of the total cost of planned projects run as high as $6 trillion (640 trillion yen), though it's unclear if all will be built.Ansteel, in Liaoning province, has won bids to supply steel for railways in Thailand and Kenya. In Pakistan, the company has delivered 8,000 tons of track for the $1.6 billion Orange Line of the Lahore Metro.\"Where the Belt and Road construction goes, our railway tracks will follow,\" said Wang Jun, manager of Ansteel's Bayuquan production base in Yingkou.State-owned Ansteel is among dozens of suppliers of steel, industrial equipment and other goods in the region that are pinning their export hopes on Chinese building projects.Liaoning was left behind as market-style economic reforms transformed China's east coast and southeast into the world's factory.Most Belt and Road projects are financed by Chinese bank loans and built by Chinese contractors using technology, steel and other materials from China.The government releases no information on the number of projects or the scale of investment. Less than $200 billion had been spent through the end of 2018, according to Derek Scissors at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.Liaoning's exports to Belt and Road countries rose 20.3 percent in the first quarter of 2019 from a year earlier, according to the provincial Commerce Department.Sales to Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates doubled, said the department's deputy director, He Rui.U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes have dented Liaoning's exports, but the United States accounts for only 10 percent of its foreign sales of car parts, refined oil and farm goods, said He.Ansteel built the Bayuquan base to sell to Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea, according to Wang.Many host governments want more building materials to come from local suppliers, but Belt and Road still is an export opportunity for Chinese suppliers of high-speed rail, power plant and other technology.Dalian Huarui Heavy Industry supplied equipment for the $3.3 billion Hassyan coal-fired power station in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.Huarui has contracts in 15 Belt and Road countries, including Bangladesh and Pakistan, said its vice president, Wei Xufeng. Wei said those account for 60 percent of its exports and 20 percent of total revenue.Local leaders are promoting Dalian in Liaoning, the northeast's busiest port, as a Belt and Road hub to connect shippers with East Asia and Europe.Plans call for opening six railway routes and more than 100 sea routes, according to Xia Ting, manager of Dalian Container Development of Liaoning Port Group.Trains on one of six routes that link Dalian with Russia carry Samsung electronic products and components made by other washing machine and television manufacturers. In 2017, the line carried a total of 4,500 containers of goods worth $270 million.\"In the future, we aim to sell more with high added value,\" said Xia. \"We think these are suitable for China-Europe cargo trains.\"The port can move Japanese and South Korean autos to Kazakhstan or other Central Asian countries by train, said Ding Hao, manager of Dalian Car Wharf.\"Belt and Road will bring us significant benefits, but we need some time to see it,\" said Ding.Still, Belt and Road faces hurdles that might trip up hopes for boosting Chinese exports.Governments including Thailand, Tanzania, Sri Lanka and Nepal have scaled back or renegotiated projects they said were too costly or gave too little work to local contractors.Ansteel's experiences reflect the potential volatility of exports based on the ebb and flow of Chinese-led construction projects. It reported 2018 exports of 5.8 billion RMB ($840 million), or about 5.5 percent of its total revenue, down by 10 percent from 2017.Developing countries need industrial equipment but cannot replace U.S. demand for consumer goods, said economist Zhu Zhenxin at the Rushi Financial Institute in Beijing.The northeast also is targeted in a multi-year government effort to shrink the bloated state-owned steel industry in hopes of making producers more efficient and profitable.Liaoning closed 18 steel mills and eliminated 6 million tons of production capacity in 2016.Policies aimed at reviving the northeast were unveiled by Beijing in 2003, but the region is struggling with pollution and an aging population.In 2016, Liaoning's economy shrank by 2.5 percent. Its output was less than one-third that of Guangdong province, the manufacturing powerhouse that abuts Hong Kong.The total population of Liaoning and the two other provinces in China's northeast--Jilin and Heilongjiang--declined by 380,000 people last year as migrants left for other regions in search of work.", "Gambling hub Macau set to elect Beijing-backed leader,REUTERS,August,21,2019": "HONG KONG--The Chinese territory of Macau is set to elect as leader the only candidate for which it is allowed to vote: a Beijing-backed former legislator who is expected to cement China's control over the special administrative region and distance it from escalating protests in neighboring Hong Kong.The selection of former legislature head Ho Iat Seng--the sole candidate approved to run--is scheduled for Sunday, when he will be chosen by a 400-member pro-Beijing committee to lead the world's largest gambling hub for at least the next five years.The 62-year-old's highly scripted appointment comes as the former Portuguese colony tries to position itself as a beacon of stability and model for the Chinese government's \"one country, two systems\" formula through which Beijing administers Macau and Hong Kong.\"Many people expressed they do not want to mess up Macau,\" Ho told local media this week, explaining that he had heard much opposition to the protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its deepest political crisis since its handover to Beijing in 1997.Ho, who has deep ties to China and was on the committee of the mainland's prestigious legislative body, said local youth could resist the influence of Hong Kong's protesters and supported measures to boost patriotism in Macau.Although anti-government protests have roiled the former British colony of Hong Kong for nearly three months, Macau has seen little dissent to Beijing's rule.Many in Macau, particularly the middle-aged and elderly, have sought to distance themselves from the movement.\"People in Macau are more satisfied. Everyone is secure with their jobs. We have annual payments. We are comfortable and we are grateful for it,\" said Ms. Leong, a marketing executive who declined to give her first name.Chinese rule has generally been welcomed in Macau, which has seen economic growth soar and a sustained period of stability--a sharp contrast to the years preceding the handover in 1999, when there were a series of mob wars.About half of Macau's population of 600,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was born in the territory. In recent years, millions of dollars have been piled into creating youth associations linked to the Chinese government that encourage study and learning in the mainland. Macau's behavior has pleased Beijing. In state media this week, netizens applauded the swift shutdown of a planned unlawful protest against what activists described as excessive violence by Hong Kong's police.Police told Reuters that dozens of officers were deployed on Monday to the historic Senado Square, where the protest was meant to take place, and that 30 people were \"investigated\". The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said on its online Weibo account \"why are Macau people so excellent#? It comes to the importance of education.\" Other comments praised Macau's police enforcement and local mindset. \"Positive life is meaningful,\" wrote another user. \"Macau doesn't want to respond to Hong Kong. Don't prevent Macau people from making money, you are not welcome to revolt here.\"Ho, who campaigned on integrating Macau's economy with the Greater Bay Area and improving livelihoods, will take over from incumbent Fernando Chui in December as Macau celebrates 20 years under Chinese rule and President Xi Jinping is slated to visit.The Communist Party will also mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on Oct 1. Macau-born Ho moved into government in the early 2000s after starting off in the family business under his industrial tycoon father, Ho Tin. He has no ties to the casino industry, in contrast to previous leaders, and will play a key role in determining what will happen to the six casino operators--Sands China, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco Resorts and MGM China--when their licenses expire in coming years. Ho has said he wants \"healthy\" development for the gambling industry, as it is the main source of tax revenue for the government. He has also warned that the protests and the China-U.S. trade war could hurt Macau's economy.As Hong Kong's protests have intensified, Ho has cautioned against rushing through controversial legislation such as national education and a public investment vehicle, and stated that the government needs to be more inclusive.But Macau pro-democratic activists, mainly in their 20s and 30s, say the city has a broken and undemocratic political system and called on the international community to support Macau's efforts for democratization.An open letter from a group of anonymous locals on Wednesday demanded universal suffrage and said Beijing had been imposing stronger control with increasingly authoritarian rule. \"The time to fight for our universal rights is now, before Macau becomes just another Chinese city,\" the letter said. \"The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong right now. But please also take a look at its next door neighbor.\"", "Britain upset by reports HK consulate worker held in China,REUTERS,August,21,2019": "HONG KONG--Britain said on Tuesday it was \"extremely concerned\" by reports that a staff member at the consulate in its former colony of Hong Kong had been detained in mainland China.Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported, citing an interview with his girlfriend and family.Cheng's family confirmed his disappearance in a Facebook post on Tuesday night, saying he traveled from Hong Kong to Shenzhen on the morning of Aug. 8 for a business trip.\"He traveled back to Hong Kong by high-speed rail on the evening of the same day, and sent messages to his girlfriend via WhatsApp and WeChat while he was about to pass customs at about 10 p.m. We lost contact with him since then,\" the post said.Hong Kong has been gripped by anti-government protests in recent weeks, with Beijing accusing Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs.Britain, the United States and other countries have urged China to respect the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\"We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen,\" a representative of Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement released by the British embassy in Beijing.\"We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong,\" the representative said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the case.

But he had never reshuffled one on short notice, with tariffs hanging over his head.\"It is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in all my 30 years in the business,\" said Sloven, president of Capstone International HK Ltd., a division of Florida-based Capstone Companies.\"You've got packaging, assembling, auditing, labor, overheads, components, logistics, transportation,\" he said. \"I went from first gear to fourth gear very quickly.\"Sloven, a native of Long Island, New York, cut his teeth in Asia in the 1970s sourcing lighting products from Japan. He then moved to Taiwan and then mainland China, making and sourcing electrical products for AT&T and Duracell, before becoming a buying agent for sporting goods retailer Dick's.He joined Capstone in 2012 to manage its network of Chinese manufacturers from Hong Kong.Rising labor costs and tighter regulations in China had already led him to consider moving the business elsewhere in Asia. But the trade war forced his hand.Through dozens of interviews and phone, Whatsapp and email exchanges over a year, Reuters documented Sloven's quest to uproot his supply chain operation, an effort entailing many close calls, bureaucratic headaches--and some good luck.Sloven is just one of thousands of entrepreneurs who have been forced by the trade war to upend their business operations in China in the biggest supply chain shift in a generation.Companies like Capstone contribute over $200 billion (21 trillion yen) in U.S. purchases of China-made electronics and machinery annually.When Washington imposed the first tariffs in July 2018, Capstone's core products, such as battery-powered LED bulbs and motion-activated lighting, were not on the list.Nor were some Capstone prototypes that Sloven sees as the future of the company: \"smart furniture\" like a mirror that doubles as a touchscreen with Internet access.But his instinct was that U.S.-China ties were taking a turn for the worse.\"You don't know what's coming next in China,\" he said.He set his sights on Thailand as the site of a possible second production base. Sourcing raw materials locally was difficult, but at least they carried no import duties. Setting up a business entity in Thailand was also cheap and fast, and some of the work could be subcontracted.A U.S. trade official in Thailand introduced him to various local companies who could help.\"I will be able to make products in Thailand,\" Sloven said at the end of last summer. But, he added, \"it's not going to be easy.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump gave him an even better reason to move.The total value of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods was expanded from $50 billion to $250 billion, putting Capstone's LED products in the cross-hairs of 10 percent levies.Smart furniture, if made in China, would take a hit.Soon after, a survey by AmCham China, which represents U.S. businesses, showed that a third of its members were planning to shift the sourcing of components or assemble some goods outside of China.Sloven's efforts in Thailand appeared to have paid off. After numerous meetings, he found a furniture factory and an assembler outside Bangkok that could help him.Both had international experience and were expanding to meet increasing demand from U.S. firms. And while smart furniture was new to them, they were confident they could pull it off and were ready to invest. The companies cannot be named because of non-disclosure agreements.After a site visit in February, Sloven ordered components for his smart mirror to be shipped to Thailand. By mid-March, Capstone engineers were showing the factory how to put them together.\"I'm not concerned,\" Sloven said in February. \"I'm giving him the information step by step,\" he said, referring to his Thai partner.Even as Sloven grew more optimistic, the urgency to leave China seemed to abate as 2019 began.Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had declared a cautious truce at a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, and it seemed to be holding. Officials on both sides were suggesting a deal before a March deadline, and the threat of tariffs rising to 25 percent seemed distant.But Sloven was sticking to his plan.\"I don't think there's going to be a trade war, but that doesn't change things,\" he said at the time.The March deadline passed, but tariffs remained unchanged. That gave Sloven breathing room.He scheduled a series of pilot runs to test how well the Thai factory handled assembly. He also needed to prepare for audits of labor rights and environmental standards that U.S. retailers require.He estimated that would take at least another six months.\"I'm going to start moving on a small scale because they're not going to be able to just do it immediately,\" Sloven said. \"As much as they say, 'Oh, I can do this right now'--I'm not taking that chance.\"More investment in tooling and molds was required, too, but the Thai companies agreed to bear the cost.Regardless of what happened with the trade war, Sloven felt covered.\"You prepare for war,\" he said. \"You're ready if you're attacked.\"Sloven also had work to do in China.His suppliers in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Guangzhou were certain the trade conflict would blow over and were reluctant to negotiate deals that would send components and raw materials abroad for assembly.But Sloven kept pressing ahead with the Thailand plan, concerned about the toll the trade war was taking in China.In early April, Sloven invited Reuters to meet his trade lawyer, Sally Peng of Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg.Peng described how Chinese factory floors were emptying out as workers were laid off. Few owners had the expertise or resources to automate or find new export markets, so most were riding it out, hoping for a trade deal. They were \"losing money every day,\" she said.\"They believe that eventually it will all come back,\" Sloven said.\"I think within five years, it will all be gone,\" Peng replied.The same day Sloven met his lawyer, his bosses in Florida announced 2018 results that reflected the effects of the trade war. Net revenues came in at $12.8 million, down from $36.8 million in 2017. Net losses were $1 million, a swing from a $3.1 million profit.\"Capstone faced challenges in 2018 unlike any in its history,\" chief financial officer Gerry McClinton said.Meanwhile, development of the smart mirror was in full swing. The prototype was deemed a success at a Las Vegas electronics show in January, and a PR agency and a marketing company were hired to advertise the new product.Then Trump hiked tariffs to 25 percent on May 10.For Sloven--and many others--the urgency level bounced back up. That month, a survey by AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai showed the number of firms that had moved production or were considering doing so leaped above 40 percent.To speed things up, Sloven introduced the Thai assemblers to his Chinese suppliers.He wanted to set the rules of the game and then let them interact independently. Those meetings had to go well, or all could fall apart.In a stroke of luck, he discovered the two sides had something in common.\"The Thai guy, his family was from China originally so he spoke a certain dialect. And the factory in China--my supplier--and him speak the same dialect,\" Sloven said. \"What a home run!\"After months of digging in its heels, the Chinese company finally relented and agreed to supply Sloven in Thailand.With his supply of components and raw materials secured, the next big step was the audits.Thirty-five percent of the product had to be made in Thailand for the product to be considered Thai, and thus exempt from American tariffs.A certificate from an independent auditor would prove that, but the auditing usually takes four to five weeks.\"I know what I have to do, but getting the information is mind boggling. These are supply chain issues that everyone in the world is going to have to face,\" Sloven said.Logistics was another concern for Sloven. Shipping to the United States from Thailand takes 8-10 days longer than it does from China.Despite the extra costs and time, Sloven thinks he will be able to make the product for the same price as in China without the tariffs.And by the middle of the summer of 2019, Sloven was confident that most of his challenges had been overcome and that the smart mirror would ship on schedule on Oct. 1.But, he allowed, \"there's always going to be hiccups.\"", "Huawei expects no relief from US sanctions but is confident,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "SHENZHEN, China--The founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei said Tuesday he expects no relief from U.S. export curbs due to the political climate in Washington but expressed confidence the company will thrive because it is developing its own technology.Ren Zhengfei also said he doesn't want relief from U.S. sanctions if it requires China to make concessions in a tariff war, even if that means his daughter, who is under house arrest in Canada on U.S. criminal charges, faces a longer legal struggle.In an interview at Huawei's sprawling, leafy headquarters campus in this southern city, the 74-year-old Ren said Huawei expects U.S. curbs on most technology sales to go ahead despite Monday's announcement of a second 90-day delay. He said no one in Washington would risk standing up for the company.The biggest impact will be on American vendors that sell chips and other components to Huawei, the biggest maker of network gear for phone companies, he said.Washington has placed Huawei on an \"entity list\" of foreign companies that require official permission to buy American technology.\"Whether the 'entity list' is extended or not, that will not have a substantial impact on Huawei's business,\" said Ren. \"We can do well without relying on American companies.\"Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, is at the center of a battle over trade and technology that threatens to tip the global economy into recession. American officials accuse the company, also the No. 2 global smartphone brand, of stealing technology and facilitating Chinese spying, accusations Huawei denies.Huawei's chief financial officer, who is also Ren's daughter, is fighting extradition from Canada to face U.S. charges related to possible violation of trade curbs on Iran. Beijing arrested two Canadians in a possible attempt to force her release.Ren looked relaxed and confident throughout the two-hour interview at a palatial new building in neoclassical European style where Huawei entertains customers. The atmosphere was a striking contrast from a June 17 news conference at which Ren compared the company to a \"badly damaged airplane\" and warned U.S. sanctions would cut Huawei's projected smartphone sales by $30 billion (3 trillion yen) over the next two years.U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested controls on Huawei might be lifted if Beijing agrees to a deal on trade and technology disputes that led to U.S. tariff hikes on Chinese imports.Ren rejected that. He said Huawei couldn't ask for favors that might hurt the interests of China's poor majority.\"I couldn't take it if those poor people sacrificed their own interests for the benefit of Huawei,\" said Ren. \"Maybe my daughter will suffer more. But I would rather do that instead having the poorer people in China sacrifice for Huawei's survival and development.\"The May announcement of export curbs prompted warnings that sales of Huawei smartphones and other products that use U.S. chips and other technology could be devastated. The curbs also mean a loss of billions of dollars in potential annual sales for American vendors.Even before the announcement, Huawei was working on developing its own chips, software and other technology that might reduce reliance on American vendors. The company spent $15 billion last year on research and development, more than Apple Inc. or Microsoft Corp.Huawei reported sales in the six months through June rose 23.2 percent over a year earlier. Its chairman, Liang Hua, said in July that Huawei was reviewing its core products to make sure they all could be delivered to customers without American components.\"At a strategic level, the U.S. entity list is helpful to Huawei,\" said Ren. He said the company has responded by eliminating \"marginal, unimportant businesses or products\" and focusing resources on \"major products.\"\"The whole company can focus more on our most competitive products,\" he said.This month, Huawei unveiled its own smartphone operating system it said can replace the popular Android system from Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Huawei's phones still use Android but Google is blocked from supporting maps, music and other services.Earlier this year, Huawei released its own chip for next-generation smartphones and the first phone based on that chip.Ren rarely appeared in public or talked to reports before his daughter's December arrest. Since then, however, he has given a flurry of interviews to foreign reporters in an effort to repair the company's reputation.\"I think it's working,\" he said.Asked about ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which borders Shenzhen, Ren said the violence was \"not good for society and the people\" but doesn't affect Huawei.\"There is no impact at all on Huawei's business,\" he said. \"We are still focused on our own production. We still focus on fixing the holes in our bullet-riddled airplane.\"Ren, who has called himself a fan of the United States and publicly praised Trump as a leader, said Huawei wants to retain technology collaboration with Google, Microsoft and other American developers.\"A strong position for Huawei in the market will translate into a strong position for U.S. companies, because deep inside, our products are powered by American technologies,\" said Ren.If Huawei is blocked from using Android and is forced to develop alternative systems, \"it wouldn't be in the best interests of the United States,\" Ren said.He said even if Huawei develops its own alternatives, it is willing to buy American components to support industry development.\"We hope we can and we will continue to be able to buy American components,\" he said. \"Even though we may have the ability to turn out our own components or products, we would choose to reduce our own capacity so as to use more American components in order to contribute together to share the prosperity of society.\"Ren said Huawei is planning as if the U.S. export restrictions will remain in place.\"It isn't possible that someone in the United States will step up to revoke the entity list designation,\" he said. \"Right now, attacking Huawei in the United States is politically correct, while helping Huawei even once would put them under significant pressure. So to us, the entity list will be there for quite some time.\"", "Die-hard Hong Kong protesters defend tactics as unity cracks,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "HONG KONG--On a recent sweltering Saturday, a day now reserved for protest in Hong Kong, a demonstrator named Wayne stepped past a row of plastic barricades, lifted a pair of binoculars and squinted.Four hundred meters away, a line of riot police stood with full-length shields, batons and tear-gas launchers.It was a familiar sight for Wayne after more than two months on the front lines of Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrations. Face-offs with police have become part of the 33-year-old philosophy professor's new normal.The stories of Wayne and three other self-described \"front line\" protesters interviewed by The Associated Press provide insights into how what started as a largely peaceful movement against proposed changes to the city's extradition law has morphed into a summer of tear gas and rubber bullets. They spoke on condition they be identified only by partial names because they feared arrest.The movement has reached a moment of reckoning after protesters occupying Hong Kong's airport last week held two mainland Chinese men captive, beating them because they believed the men were infiltrating their movement.Pro-democracy lawmakers and fellow demonstrators have questioned whether the operation had gone too far.It was the first crack in what has been astonishing unity across a wide range of protesters. It gave pause to the front-liners, though they still believe their more disruptive tactics are necessary to get the government to answer the broader movement's demands.The demands grew from opposing legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited for trials in mainland China's murky judicial system to pressing for democratic elections, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's resignation and an investigation into allegations of police brutality at the demonstrations.The protesters on the front lines have thrown bricks at police, trashed the legislature's chambers, blocked a major tunnel under Hong Kong's harbor and pelted police headquarters with eggs.To Lam, these are \"violent rioters\" bent on destroying the city's economy. To China's ruling Communist Party, their actions are \"the first signs of terrorism.\"To the most die-hard protesters, there's no turning back.\"The situation has evolved into a war in Hong Kong society,\" said Tin, a 23-year-old front-line demonstrator. \"It's the protesters versus the police.\"When Hong Kong's youth banded together to protest, they said they would not have clear leaders, protecting individuals from becoming symbols or scapegoats. And they would stick together, no matter their methods.These were lessons learned from 2014, when the Occupy Central pro-democracy movement fizzled after more than two months.Chong, a 24-year-old front-liner, said everyone's opinion is considered, and they decide on the right path together. But no decision is absolute: The demonstrators have pledged to not impede actions they may disagree with.Two massive marches roused Chong and others who had given up on political change.On consecutive weekends in June, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to oppose the extradition bill. It struck at fears that China is eroding civil rights that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\"I didn't think I would ever do this again,\" said Chong, who quit his job as an environmental consultant for the protests. \"But this time, society is waking up.\"Lam suspended the bill indefinitely the day before the second march, but it didn't mollify the protesters, who turned out in even greater numbers.As their demands expanded, Lam offered dialogue but showed no signs of giving ground.That's when hard-liners like Chong and Wayne became convinced that peaceful protest might not be enough.Week after week, they clashed with police. Every round of tear gas only seemed to deepen their conviction that the government did not care.\"We've had numerous peaceful protests that garnered no response whatsoever from the government,\" said J.C., a 27-year-old hairstylist who quit his job in July. \"Escalating our actions is both natural and necessary.\"Then came the \"white shirt\" attack. On July 21, dozens of men beat people indiscriminately with wooden poles and steel rods in a commuter rail station as protesters returned home, injuring 44. They wore white in contrast to the protesters' trademark black.A slow police response led to accusations of collusion. Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said resources were stretched because of the protests.Many saw the attack as proof police prioritized catching demonstrators--around 700 have been arrested so far--over more violent criminals.As protesters' rage grew, they set their sights on Hong Kong's airport.Hundreds of flights were canceled over two consecutive nights last week as protesters blocked access to check-in counters and immigration.While the major disruption of one of the world's busiest airports got global attention, it was the vigilante attacks on two Chinese men that troubled the movement.In a written apology, a group of unnamed protesters said recent events had fueled a \"paranoia and rage.\" During the prior weekend's demonstrations, people dressed like protesters had been caught on video making arrests, and police acknowledged use of decoy officers.At the airport, the protesters twice thought they found undercover agents in their ranks, detaining two men, interrogating them and beating them. One turned out to be a reporter for China's state-owned Global Times newspaper.Footage of the mob violence inflamed anti-protester sentiment in China. In Hong Kong, pro-democracy lawmakers said it was something that \"will not and should not happen again.\"Some protesters apologized for becoming easily agitated and overreacting. Others questioned whether provocateurs had incited the violence.Wayne said he couldn't get through the crowd to see what was happening during the airport beating, but he understood how the attackers felt.\"I would have done the same thing,\" he said. \"It's not rational, but I would have kicked him or punched him at least once or twice.\"", "Hong Kong leader sees \u00e2\u0080\u0098way out\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of chaos through dialogue,REUTERS,August,20,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped a peaceful weekend anti-government protest was the start of an effort to restore peace and that dialogue with peaceful protesters would provide a \"way out\" for the Chinese-ruled city.Hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied peacefully in torrential rain on Sunday in the 11th week of what have been often violent demonstrations.\"I sincerely hope that this was the beginning of society returning to peace and staying away from violence,\" Lam said.\"We will immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue. This dialogue, I hope, will be based on a mutual understanding and respect and find a way out for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hong Kong.\"Anger erupted in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in the former British colony to be extradited to mainland China.But the unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the \"one country, two systems\" formula put in place after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.Further protests are planned in the next few days, including one by MTR subway workers on Wednesday, secondary school students on Thursday and accountants on Friday.The chaos has spread overseas. Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. said on Monday they had dismantled a social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.Sunday's turnout, which organizers put at 1.7 million, showed that the movement still has widespread support despite chaotic scenes last week when protesters occupied the airport.Some activists had apologized for the airport turmoil and protesters could be seen on Sunday night urging others to go home peacefully.Aside from Lam's resignation, demonstrators have five demands--complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, a halt to descriptions of the protests as \"rioting,\" a waiver of charges against those arrested, an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.\"The second question I have repeatedly replied on various locations and I can give you this very clear commitment at the political level is that the bill is dead,\" Lam said. \"There is no plan to revive the bill, especially in light of the public concerns.\"Police have been criticized for using increasingly aggressive tactics to break up demonstrations but there was a minimal police presence on Sunday and no arrests were made. More than 700 people have been arrested since June.Lam said the police watchdog had set up a task force to investigate complaints.The protests have hit the economy of Hong Kong, one of the world's busiest ports, with the Asian financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade.Lam said she hoped Hong Kong had \"unique advantages in attracting overseas companies,\" stressing the rule of law, but warned of the risk of pressure on the economy which shrank 0.4 percent in April-June from the previous quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half. Actually, I think the data in the first half has not fully reflected the seriousness of the problem,\" she said.Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Lau said on RTHK Radio that the likelihood of recession was \"quite considerable.\"China has put strong pressure on big companies in Hong Kong over the protests, especially Cathay Pacific Airways. CEO Rupert Hogg quit in a shock move last week after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in the protests.Hogg's sudden departure was announced by Chinese state television on Friday and was seen as a signal to other multinationals, such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing.Cathay also fired two pilots for taking part in protests.China's State Council on Monday called for greater development of the southern city of Shenzhen and integration of its culture and economy with neighboring Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.The Council called for greater development of the so-called Greater Bay Area and to enrich the \"one country, two systems\" policy.", "Twitter shuts Chinese accounts targeting Hong Kong protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "WASHINGTON--Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and \"because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed,\" the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations. The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies.\"We continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. \"We're also taking a closer look at ads that have been raised to us to determine if they violate our policies.\"Twitter traced the Hong Kong campaign to two fake Chinese and English Twitter accounts that pretended to be news organizations based in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets since early June calling for full democracy and an inquiry into what they say is police violence against protesters.Though Twitter is banned in China, it is available in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous region.The Chinese language account, @HKpoliticalnew, and the English account, @ctcc507, pushed tweets depicting protesters as violent criminals in a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion around the world. One of those accounts was tied to a suspended Facebook account that went by the same moniker: HKpoliticalnew.An additional 936 core accounts Twitter believes originated from within China attempted to sow political discord in Hong Kong by undermining the protest movement's legitimacy and political positions.About 200,000 more automated Twitter accounts amplified the messages, engaging with the core accounts in the network. Few tweeted more than once, the official said, mostly because Twitter quickly caught many of them.The Twitter official said the investigation remains ongoing and there could be further disclosures.The Twitter campaign reflects the fact that the Chinese government has studied the role of social media in mass movements and fears the Hong Kong protests could spark wider unrest, said James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"This is standard Chinese practice domestically, and we know that after 2016 they studied what the Russians did in the U.S. carefully,\" Lewis said. \"So it sounds like this is the first time they're deploying their new toy.\"Twitter has sought to more aggressively monitor its network for malicious political activity since the 2016 presidential election and to be more transparent about its investigations, publicly releasing such data about state-backed influence operations since October so others can evaluate it, the official said.\"We're not only telling the public this happened, we're also putting the data out there so people can study it for themselves,\" the official said.As for state-backed media organizations, they are still allowed to use Twitter, but are no longer allowed to pay for ads, which show up regardless of whether you have elected to follow the group's tweet.Twitter declined to provide a list of what it considers state-backed media organizations, but a representative said it may consider doing so in the future. In 2017, Twitter specifically announced it would ban Russia-based RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform.", "China lashes out at Taiwan over Hong Kong political asylum offer,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,20,2019": "HONG KONG--China lashed out at Taiwan on Monday over its offer of political asylum to participants in Hong Kong's pro-democracy protest movement, a day after hundreds of thousands of people marched peacefully in the latest massive demonstration in the Chinese territory.The government of Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China considers its own territory, strongly supports the protests, and Hong Kong students in Taiwan held events over the weekend expressing their backing. Taiwan's president made the asylum offer last month, though it's not clear if requests have been received.Taiwan lacks a formal legal mechanism for assessing and granting asylum requests, although it has granted residency to several vocal opponents of the Chinese government.On Monday, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Chinese Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan's offer would \"cover up the crimes of a small group of violent militants\" and encourage their \"audacity in harming Hong Kong and turn Taiwan into a \"heaven for ducking the law.\"Ma demanded that Taiwan's government \"cease undermining the rule of law\" in Hong Kong, cease interfering in its affairs and not \"condone criminals.\"Organizers said at least 1.7 million people participated in Sunday's Hong Kong rally and march, although the police estimate was far lower. Police said the protest was \"generally peaceful\" but accused a large group of people of \"breaching public peace\" afterward by occupying a major thoroughfare and using slingshots to shoot \"hard objects\" at government headquarters and pointing lasers at police officers.The protests have at times been marked by violent clashes with police, who say they have arrested more than 700 participants since the demonstrations started in June. However, law enforcement officers kept a low profile Sunday, with no riot police seen from the procession's main routes. When stragglers convened outside a government complex in the late evening, other protesters urged them to go home.More protests are planned for the coming weeks, with various rallies organized by accountants, transport workers, high school students and relatives of police officers.Demonstrators' frustrations over what they perceive to be the government's refusal to respond to their demands boiled over last week with the occupation of Hong Kong's international airport, during which a reporter for a Chinese Communist Party-owned newspaper was assaulted, and attacks on a number of police stations.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to Beijing in 1997 under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised residents certain democratic rights not afforded to people in mainland China. But some Hong Kongers have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of eroding their freedoms in recent years.The protest movement's demands include the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, democratic elections and an independent investigation into police use of force.Asked Sunday about the situation in Hong Kong, U.S. President Donald Trump said the use of Chinese troops to put down the protests--similar to the bloody crackdown on protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989--would worsen the current U.S.-China trade dispute.\"I mean if it's another Tiananmen Square, I think it's a very hard thing to do if there is violence,\" Trump told reporters in New Jersey. \"I think there'd be tremendous political sentiment not to do something.\"Trump had originally said the protests were a matter for China to handle but has since suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping could resolve the situation by meeting with protest leaders.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang avoided commenting on Trump's remarks directly, but referred to the president's previous statements on the protests.\"We have noticed that President Trump has previously stated that Hong Kong is part of China, and that they must solve it themselves and do not need advice. We hope that the U.S. side can match its acts to its words,\" Geng told reporters at a daily briefing.China has furiously rejected all outside calls for it to discuss protesters' demands.Members of China's paramilitary People's Armed Police force have been training for days across the border in Shenzhen, including on Sunday morning, fueling speculation that they could be sent in to suppress the protests. The Hong Kong police, however, have said they are capable of handling the demonstrations.", "Asian shares climb on stimulus hopes as recession fears ease,REUTERS,August,20,2019": "Asian shares extended their gains on Tuesday as hopes for stimulus in major economies tempered anxiety about a global recession, boosting riskier assets and drawing money from safe-havens such as bonds and gold.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.31 percent, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.45 percent. The improved mood was helped by a rally on Wall Street overnight, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.21 percent.Shares in China and Hong Kong opened lower and swung in and out of negative territory after China lowered its lending reference rate only slightly in the first publication of a new benchmark since new interest rate reforms were announced on Saturday.Oil futures were also down in a tentative sign that worries about an attack at a Saudi oil field over the weekend have eased, but some traders were nervously monitoring an Iranian tanker at the center of a clash between Tehran and Washington.For now, however, investors were cheered by signs policymakers were willing to do more to support their economies in the grip of international trade frictions, led by the bruising Sino-U.S. tariff tussle.The immediate focus shifts to the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting due on Wednesday. Traders are also keenly waiting on the Fed's Jackson Hole seminar and a Group of Seven summit this weekend for clues on what additional steps policymakers will take to bolster growth.Senior White House officials are discussing a temporary payroll tax cut to boost the economy, the Washington Post reported on Monday.Hopes for additional stimulus are rising after reports that Germany is prepared to increase fiscal spending, and after the People's Bank of China took steps to lower corporate borrowing costs.\"There are expectations for looser monetary policy everywhere in the world, and this is cushioning the markets against recent uncertain developments,\" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.\"China is prepared to do a lot for its economy. I hope to hear more about fiscal spending in Germany. Central banks have no choice but to ease. The remaining question is what comes from fiscal policy.\"U.S. stock futures were a shade lower in Asian trading, down 0.14 percent, while benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields eased slightly to 1.5893 percent, and 2-year yields traded at 1.5248 percent.Elsewhere, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.69 percent, while South Korea's KOSPI index rose 0.24 percent.China set its new one-year Loan Prime Rate at 4.25 percent, down 6 basis points from 4.31 percent previously. It was 10 basis points lower than the People's Bank of China's existing benchmark one-year lending rate.The new five-year LPR rate was set at 4.85 percent, according to the national interbank funding center.Chinese shares initially fell at the open but recovered to trade up 0.19 percent. Stocks in Hong Kong also rose 0.15 percent, erasing an earlier loss.\"China has liberalized the lending rate, but they couldn't shock the banking system by taking rates down sharply,\" said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.\"They have to do this incrementally. They announced this over the weekend to show the direction they're headed. From that standpoint, I don't think it's disappointing.\"Markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut rates again at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting from the current 2.00 percent-2.25 percent. The Fed cut rates in July for the first time in a decade to mitigate the effects of the U.S.-China trade row and a global slowdown.Last week, financial markets went into a tailspin after the Treasury yield curve briefly inverted when short-term yields traded above those of long-term paper. Investors, who feared a steep global downturn given an inverted yield curve has presaged several past U.S. recessions, dumped riskier assets.However, a bounce in yields from lows hit last week has eased some of the concerns about the global economy.Gold, which is traditionally bought as a safe-haven during times of uncertainty, held steady at $1,495.69 per ounce after tumbling 1.2 percent on Monday, its biggest daily decline in about a month.The Swiss franc, another safe-haven asset, was last quoted at 0.9815 per dollar, near a two-week low.In the oil market, U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.27 percent to $56.06 a barrel in a sign of receding concern about tension in the Middle East, but some traders warn this lull could be temporary.Refinitiv data shows an Iranian tanker that was detained in Gibraltar is now on its way to Greece, but the U.S. State Department has warned that any assistance to the vessel could be considered as providing support to a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.", "Chinese K-pop stars publicly back Beijing on Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,19,2019": "HONG KONG--At least eight K-pop stars from China and even one from Taiwan and one from Hong Kong are publicly stating their support for Beijing's one-China policy, eliciting a mixture of disappointment and understanding from fans.Many of the statements came after protesters opposed to Beijing's growing influence over semi-autonomous Hong Kong removed a Chinese flag and tossed it into Victoria Harbor earlier this month.Lay Zhang, Jackson Wang, Lai Kuan-lin and Victoria Song were among the K-pop singers who recently uploaded a Chinese flag and declared themselves as \"one of 1.4 billion guardians of the Chinese flag\" on their official Weibo social media accounts. Wang is from Hong Kong and Lai is from Taiwan.Some see the public pronouncements as the latest examples of how celebrities and companies feel pressured to toe the line politically in the important Chinese market. Yet they also coincide with a surge in patriotism among young Chinese raised on a steady diet of pro-Communist Party messaging.Song and Zhang, a member of popular group EXO, have shown their Chinese pride on Instagram, in Song's case uploading an image of the Chinese flag last week with the caption \"Hong Kong is part of China forever.\" Such posts would only be seen by their international fans because Instagram, like most Western social media sites, is blocked by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's censors.K-pop fans reacted swiftly to the avowals of allegiance to China. Some called it shameful, while others were more understanding.Erika Ng, a 26-year-old Hong Kong fan of Jackson Wang, was not surprised by his statement. She said he \"values the China market more than the Hong Kong market\" because of his large presence in the mainland.Wang, a member of the group Got7, used to carry a Hong Kong flag and wear a hat with the city's symbol, a bauhinia flower. Lately, he has been carrying a Chinese flag on his concert tour and was wearing a China flag hoodie in his music video.Ellyn Bukvich, a 26-year-old American who has been an EXO fan for five years, said many young fans will probably support Zhang and his message because of his status as a K-pop idol.\"It's spreading propaganda and it's very effective,\" Bukvich said.The one-China policy maintains that there is only one Chinese government, and it is a key diplomatic point accepted by most nations in the world, including the U.S. It is mostly aimed at the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.In the case of Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to Chinese control in 1997, Beijing maintains a one country, two systems policy in which the city is guaranteed greater freedoms than those on the mainland until 2047.China's government and entirely state-controlled media have consistently portrayed the Hong Kong protest movement as an effort by criminals trying to split the territory from China, backed by hostile foreigners.International brands--from fashion companies to airlines--have in the past been compelled to make public apologies for perceived breaches of that policy, such as listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate countries on their websites or T-shirts.Zhang terminated his partnership with Samsung Electronics last week, accusing the South Korean mobile giant of damaging China's \"sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"The statement in a Weibo post was prompted by Samsung having separate language options for users in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan on their global website. Both Hong Kong and Taiwan use traditional Chinese characters instead of the simplified ones used in mainland China, and Hong Kong also has English as an official languages. Samsung declined to comment on whether it will continue to provide different language options for Taiwan and Hong Kong.It can be difficult to know whether loyalty vows to Beijing are heartfelt or for commercial reasons. The past is littered with examples of celebrities, both Chinese and foreign, who saw their business in China destroyed after the party objected to a statement or an action.In 2016, Taiwanese K-pop star Chou Tzu-yu made a public apology for waving the Taiwanese flag while appearing on a South Korean television show. A Chinese vilification campaign against her led to a backlash among some Taiwanese, who at the time were amid a presidential election eventually won by Tsai Ing-wen, who is despised by Beijing for her pro-independence stance.Public support for Beijing hasn't been limited to pop stars.Liu Yifei, the Chinese-born star of Disney's upcoming live-action version of the film \"Mulan,\" weighed in on the situation in Hong Kong, where protesters have accused police of abuses.\"I support the Hong Kong police,\" she wrote on her Weibo account. \"You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.\"Some questioned her motives, wondering if the post was calculated to ensure her film is released widely in China--the world's largest film market. Among Hong Kong protesters, there were swift calls for a boycott of the film when it is released next year.", "China lashes out at Taiwan over Hong Kong political asylum offer,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,19,2019": "BEIJING--China is lashing out at Taiwan over its offer of political asylum to participants in Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.Spokesman for the Cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office Ma Xiaoguang said Monday the offer would \"cover up the crimes of a small group of violent militants\" and encourage their \"audacity in harming Hong Kong and turn Taiwan into a 'heaven for ducking the law.\"The government of the self-ruled island China considers its own territory strongly supports the protests, and Hong Kong students in Taiwan held events over the weekend expressing their backing.

Organizers said at least 1.7 million participated, though the police estimate was far lower.The assembly was peaceful, with no reports of violence, making for a rare calm weekend in a protest movement that has been marked by violent clashes with police. Law enforcement officers kept a low profile, with no riot police seen from the procession's main routes. When stragglers convened outside a government complex in the late evening, other protesters urged them to go home.Demonstrators who were shining laser pointers at a government building were convinced to leave, prompting applause from others in the group.\"We hope to see whether the government gives a response to this peaceful protest,\" said Michael Leung, a 24-year-old who was ushering his fellow demonstrators away. \"If we get a negative response, we cannot control the next (gathering).\"Organizer Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front said earlier in the day that she hoped there would be no \"chaotic situations.\"\"We hope we can show the world that Hong Kong people can be totally peaceful,\" she said.The Civil Human Rights Front had organized three previous massive marches in Hong Kong since June.

Demonstrators nevertheless fanned out and filled the streets, as there was not enough space at the designated assembly area.Public transit trains did not stop at stations near the assembly because of overcrowding.Jimmy Shan of the Civil Human Rights Front said the group estimated that at least 1.7 million took part in the rally. He said the figure did not include those who were not able to make it to Victoria Park--where the march began--due to traffic constraints.Police, whose crowd figures are generally lower than the organizers' estimates, said the turnout at the assigned location and during the designated time period was 128,000. Many protesters, however, did not follow the pre-approved guidelines laid out by the authorities.In Beijing, You Wenze, a spokesman for China's ceremonial legislature, condemned statements from U.S. lawmakers supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.You called the lawmakers' comments \"a gross violation of the spirit of the rule of law, a blatant double standard and a gross interference in China's internal affairs.\"He said that Hong Kong's 7.5 million people and the Chinese population as a whole rejected the actions of a \"very small group of violent protesters\" as well as \"any interference of foreign forces.\"You did not mention any specific lawmaker, but numerous U.S. senators and Congress members, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have affirmed the U.S. commitment to human rights and urged Hong Kong's government to end the standoff.Congress also has the power to pass legislation affecting Hong Kong's relationship with the U.S. in ways that could further erode the territory's reputation for stability and rule of law. That includes the recent reintroduction of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in Congress, which would among its other provisions require the secretary of state to issue an annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to justify special treatment afforded to the city.More directly, President Donald Trump could simply issue an executive order suspending Hong Kong's special trading status with the U.S., a move that could have a devastating effect on the local economy at a time when Beijing and Washington are engaged in a bitter trade war.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to Beijing in 1997 under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised residents certain democratic rights not afforded to people in mainland China.

Water-filled barricades fortify the airport and government offices. Posters showing bloody clashes are stuck on street corners and there is a protest nearly every night.The unrest began in June in opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill, and have since grown to include broader demands.Following an escalation in violence over the past few days, rallies on Saturday and Sunday are a test of whether the movement can retain the broad support it has appeared to enjoy.Saturday's mostly peaceful protest suggested that it may--though thousands also attended a pro-police counter-rally, and a clearer picture is not likely to emerge until Sunday when a protest is scheduled that could draw tens of thousands.\"The government has been ignoring us for months. We have to keep demonstrating,\" said CS Chan, a maths teacher at a rally of teachers, which police said up to 8,300 people had attended, in heavy rain. Organizers said 22,000 were present.Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement that has enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997.During the past week they have increasingly directed their frustration toward police, who have responded with fiercer determination to clear them from the streets.As storms cleared, anti-government demonstrators also marched through Kowloon--the main built-up area on the mainland side of Hong Kong harbor--while large pro-police crowds rallied in a harborside park across the bay.\"I'm heartbroken to see the city being split up like this,\" a retired telecoms technician, Michael Law, 69, told Reuters at the pro-police rally. \"What the violent protesters have been doing shows no respect for Hong Kong's rule of law.\"Organizers said 476,000 people attended the pro-police rally, while police said 108,000 attended. Reuters was not able to verify either estimate.Many shops in Kowloon had shut early, even on big retail boulevards, in anticipation of clashes that have tended to turn nasty at night as front-line activists attack police.On Saturday, protesters who had surrounded a police station soon vanished when riot officers advanced with shields and batons.Some said they were saving their energy for Sunday, when the pro-democracy Civil Human Rights Front, which organized million-strong peaceful marches in June, has scheduled another protest.The increasingly violent confrontations have plunged one of Asia's financial capitals into its worst crisis for decades. The unrest also presents one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, has warned activists not tip their home into an abyss.The European Union urged all sides to engage in dialogue, following other calls for restraint as Chinese paramilitary police have run drills close to the Hong Kong border.Police in Australia also warned supporters and opponents of the Hong Kong protest movement to behave after scuffles at a rally in Melbourne.Chinese officials have likened some actions by protesters to \"terrorism\" and Chinese state media outlets have urged Hong Kong police to respond more robustly.Protesters have used slingshots to fire marbles at police, shone lasers at them and at times thrown bricks and firebombs.Having fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the streets, and at one point in a subway station, police are warning that they could get tougher.Although their stations have been attacked scores of times during the crisis, they have so far refrained from deploying water cannon, armored cars or the dog squad.They have made some 750 arrests, charging some protesters with rioting, which can attract a 10-year jail term.But many remain on the side of the demonstrators.Yu, a secondary school music teacher in her 40s, said she was determined to show support for protesting students, even though she did not agree with all their actions:\"I do appreciate their courage and caring about Hong Kong ... they are definitely braver than our government.\"", "Hong Kong teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rally starts another weekend of protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of schoolteachers in Hong Kong marched to the official residence of the city's leader on Saturday as another weekend of protests got underway in the Chinese territory.An overflow crowd rallied at a nearby public square before setting off on streets that had been closed to traffic, carrying signs that read \"Protect the next generation\" and umbrellas to ward off intermittent downpours.The teachers tied white ribbons to a metal fence near Government House to show their support for the protesters, who have taken to the streets since early June and include many students.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when though.\"Alibaba's Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country's fast-growing tech sector.Officials are conscious that capital controls and the U.S. listing preference of most of China's first-generation tech giants mean that international shareholders have profited far more from their success than local investors. Mainland investors can buy Hong Kong shares through the so-called Stock Connect, which allows investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to trade shares listed on each others' exchanges.But the inclusion of Alibaba's Hong Kong shares in the Stock Connect is not guaranteed because the scheme does not yet allow mainland buying of companies which have weighted their voting rights in favor of founders, such as smartphone maker Xiaomi and Meituan Dianping, the online food delivery-to-ticketing firm. Both took advantage last year of another Hong Kong rule change to float in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights structures.While Alibaba has a single class of shares with equal votes, its governance is not considered standard since its board is controlled by a self-selecting group of company insiders.Chinese regulators have said they will allow local investors to trade companies with weighted voting rights, but have not yet set a date for doing so.Alibaba's deal must also overcome one other technical hurdle: it must gain the approval of the city's listing committee, a 27-strong independent group of industry professionals whose consent is needed for all first-time share sales.The company has been in discussions with the committee but has not yet appeared before the group at one of its regular Thursday hearings for formal approval, according to three sources.So far only Credit Suisse and CICC, the Chinese investment bank, have been mandated for the mega-listing, sources said, although several other banks are jockeying for a role on the deal, they added.All are expected to be urging caution on the listing given the size of the deal and the political and market considerations.One senior banker not involved said it made no sense to move too quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would Alibaba rush to kick it off?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.", "U.S. tells Congress of plans to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,17,2019": "WASHINGTON--The Trump administration has informed Congress it plans to sell F-16 fighters worth $8 billion to Taiwan in a move that will inflame already high tensions with China.Two U.S. officials and a congressional aide say the administration informally notified lawmakers of the proposed sale late on Thursday. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The F-16 deal is highly controversial because China fiercely opposes all arms sales to Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province, but has specifically objected to advanced fighter jets. The notification also comes as U.S. trade talks with China are stalled and amid unrest in Hong Kong that many fear could prompt Beijing to move militarily against the former British colony.The State Department, which would ultimately authorize the sale, declined to comment, but members of Congress from both parties welcomed the proposal.The chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Michael McCaul, R-Tex., said in a joint statement that it \"sends a strong message about the U.S. commitment to security and democracy in the Indo-Pacific\" and \"will help deter China as they threaten our strategic partner Taiwan and its democratic system of government.\"\"With China building up its military to threaten us and our allies, and the People's Liberation Army aiming thousands of missiles at Taiwan and deploying fighter aircrafts along the Taiwan Strait, now more than ever it is critical that Taiwan has the support needed to defend itself,\" said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The informal notification starts a period of consultations with Congress and a formal announcement of the sale could be made as early as next month unless lawmakers object.Just this week, America's top representative in Taiwan said Washington expects the island to continue increasing its defense spending as Chinese security threats to the U.S. ally continue to grow. W. Brent Christensen said the U.S. had \"not only observed Taiwan's enthusiasm to pursue necessary platforms to ensure its self-defense, but also its evolving tenacity to develop its own indigenous defense industry.\"That was a nod to President Tsai Ing-wen's drive to develop domestic training jets, submarines and other weapons technology, supplementing arms bought from the U.S.Christensen is the director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which has served as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan since formal diplomatic relations were cut in 1979.While China and Taiwan split during a civil war in 1949, Beijing still considers Taiwan Chinese territory and has increased its threats to annex the self-governing democracy by force if necessary.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, U.S. law requires Washington to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself.Since 2008, U.S. administrations have notified Congress of more than $24 billion in foreign military sales to Taiwan, including in the past two months the sale of 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, valued at $2.2 billion, Christensen said. The Trump administration alone has notified Congress of $4.4 billion in arms sales to Taiwan.China has responded furiously to all such sales and recently announced it would impose sanctions on any U.S. enterprises involved in such deals, saying they undermine China's sovereignty and national security.Tsai has adamantly rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong. She and many Taiwanese have said that the people of the island stand with the young people of Hong Kong who are fighting for democratic freedoms in ongoing protests.Beijing has cut contacts with Tsai's government over Tsai's refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan is a part of China and sought to increase Taiwan's international isolation by reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17.China has also stepped up efforts at military intimidation, holding military exercises across the Taiwan Strait and circling the island with bombers and fighters in what are officially termed training missions.", "Billionaire Kuok grants rare interview on the horrors of war,By MAYUMI MORI/ Correspondent,August,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Notoriously media-shy Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok agreed at age of 95 to be interviewed by The Asahi Shimbun to share what he heard and saw during fighting in the Asia-Pacific region during World War II.Kuok made his fortune in sugar refining and the real estate business, and also founded the Shangri-La hotel chain. According to Forbes business magazine, he is the wealthiest person in Malaysia. He also served on an advisory panel to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last year.He published his memoirs two years ago and Kuok spent the interview talking mainly about his wartime experiences, saying he did so because he wants young people to learn what happened more than 70 years ago.Excerpts of the interview follow:At the time of the incident, I was in a pineapple plantation where my family took refuge from the Japanese invasion, so I did not see the massacre. But when we were going back to Johor Bahru from the plantation, we passed by Ulu Tiram about 10 days after the incident. There I saw two skinny men who didn't seem to recognize anything or anyone. They just kept talking to themselves about what they had seen. They had gone out of their minds because of the massacre they had seen.There was not only one massacre but many. I was a student at the Raffles College, where Lee Kuan Yew (the first Singapore prime minister) was one year my senior. One of the senior students was singled out as anti-Japanese and killed in the \"Sook Ching\" (purge). He was made to kneel facing the water on Changi beach, and shot with his hands tied with barbed wire.In a war, though they are ordinary people, more than half of the soldiers will misbehave. Most of the soldiers came from poor backgrounds and they were misled.My boss in Mitsubishi, whose name was Nagaoka-san, was one of the most wonderful people I knew. He trusted me and even told me his negative view of the war, without telling me \"Kuok-san don't tell anybody.\" But there were other Japanese managers who hit my colleagues.The Japanese army said that they were out to create the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. But the \"Co-Prosperity\" meant Japan taking 90 percent and you 10 percent.In my memoir which was published in 2017, I had recounted my experience of the war and the Japanese occupation because it had left indelible memories in my mind and my soul.A few years ago, I read, for the first time, the English translation of General Tomoyuki Yamashita's last message to the Japanese people, which he dictated a few hours before he was executed for war crimes in 1946. (Yamashita was known as \"The Tiger of Malaya\" for conquering Malaya and Singapore.) When I read this, I began to see it from the other side. Yamashita had put the full depth of his feelings and emotions into words much more clearly than I could ever have done.Facing execution, Yamashita agonizes over the loss of \"priceless lives\" and the \"horror of this war.\" He deplores the \"moral decay\" of the Japanese military. He exhorts the Japanese people to build a \"new Japan\" that \"must not include militarists or scholars who try to 'rationalize war.'\"The parts of Yamashita's message which resonated most with me were his plea to his countrymen to carry out their duties \"with an independent mind and with culture and dignity,\" and his advocacy of both \"scientific\" and \"human\" education for peaceful purposes.Japan is a nation of honest, hard-working people. They only wanted to lead normal decent lives. They were misled by a handful of criminal-minded men. It was General Yamashita's fervent hope, and it is also my fervent hope, that such horrible misdeeds are never done again.", "French 'spiderman' climbs Hong Kong tower, hoists reconciliation flag amid mass protests,REUTERS,August,16,2019": "HONG KONG--French \"spiderman\" climber Alain Robert scaled a 68-story skyscraper in Hong Kong on Friday to hoist a flag symbolizing reconciliation between China and the territory as weeks of escalating pro-democracy protests show no signs of abating.Using his bare hands and without a harness, Robert clambered up Cheung Kong Center located in the central business district and secured a large banner on the building's exterior.The sign positioned China's flag in the left hand corner with Hong Kong's flag on the right side. Underneath was a yellow hand shaking a red hand on a white background to signify peace.Robert's climb comes as more mass demonstrations are expected through the weekend. China has likened the protests to terrorism and warned it could use force to quell them, as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet with protesters to defuse weeks of tension.It was the third time Robert climbed the Center, which is owned by Cheung Kong Holdings. He was banned from climbing buildings in the former British colony for a year last August. His ban ended two weeks ago.Dressed in bright hues of purple, pink and green, Robert was arrested after the climb and taken to a nearby police station.He often climbs without permission and has been arrested several times, sometimes for trespassing.Li Ka Shing, whose family owns the Cheung Kong Center, published a series of advertisements in Hong Kong's major newspapers on Friday urging people to stop the violence.Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, and have presented the biggest popular challenge to Xi since he came to power in 2012.The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspects for trial in mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy.More than 700 people have been arrested since the protests began in June, and tear gas has frequently been used by police in attempts to disperse protests across the city.", "Amazon faces online backlash in China for T-shirts with Hong Kong democracy slogans,REUTERS,August,16,2019": "SHANGHAI--Chinese social media users directed their fury at online marketplace Amazon.com on Thursday, after discovering T-shirts on its website sporting slogans that support anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.The hashtag \"Amazon T-Shirts\" became the fourth-top trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo on Wednesday in the latest backlash for an overseas company that broached matters regarding Hong Kong's territorial status.The widely-read Global Times tabloid, published by China's state-owned People's Daily, said many Chinese internet users found the T-shirts for sale carrying slogans such as \"Free Hong Kong Democracy Now\" and \"Hong Kong is Not China,\" among others.Legions of internet users accused the site of being insensitive towards the Chinese people, with one Weibo commenter writing, \"Amazon has already left China, right?

They very much want to make a deal,\" Trump told reporters. He said he had a call scheduled soon with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but he did not say when.\"I think the longer it goes the stronger we get,\" Trump said of the trade war. \"I have a feeling it's going to go fairly short,\" he said.The Chinese finance ministry said in a statement that Washington's tariffs violated a consensus reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a June summit in Japan to resolve their disputes via negotiation.In a separate statement, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said, \"We hope the U.S. will meet China halfway, and implement the consensus of the two heads of the two countries in Osaka.\"China hopes to find mutually acceptable solutions through dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect, she added.Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020 and had made the economy and his tough stance on China a key part of his 2016 campaign for the White House, on Thursday said any agreement must meet U.S. demands.\"China, frankly, would love to make a deal, and it's got to be a deal on proper terms. It's got to be a deal, frankly, on our terms. Otherwise, what's the purpose?\" Trump said in an interview on New Hampshire radio station WGIR.The trade picture is further complicated by continuing unrest in Hong Kong. Trump on Wednesday tied the situation to any possible agreement, saying Xi must first resolve the issues in the territory with protesters.On Thursday, he used Twitter to call on the Chinese president to personally meet with protesters to spur \"a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.\"Trump and Xi in June had agreed to restart trade talks after negotiations stalled earlier this year. But earlier this month, the Trump administration said it would slap duties beginning Sept. 1 on $300 billion of Chinese goods, which would effectively cover all of China's exports to the United States.

From January to May 2017, Japan held more Treasuries than China, data showed.\"The generally low- and negative-yielding sovereign debt market make Treasuries comparatively more attractive than European and Japanese debt,\" said Benjamin Jeffery, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.The steepening of the yield curve -- when rates on long-term bonds are higher than short-term notes -- in June made currency hedging costs \"a bit less onerous for foreign buyers,\" he added.China was the second largest owner of U.S. Treasuries with $1.112 trillion in June, compared with $1.110 trillion the previous month.Overall, major foreign holders of Treasuries had $6.636 trillion of U.S. government debt in June, up from $6.539 trillion in May, suggesting continued demand for the safe-haven asset.Foreign flows of U.S. Treasuries showed an outflow of $7.71 billion in June, from net selling of $32.785 billion in May. Foreign official institutions sold $14.605 billion during the month, compared with outflows from the same group totaling $21.998 billion in May.Offshore private investors purchased Treasuries amounting to $7.071 billion in June.Data also showed that after 13 straight months of selling, foreigners finally bought U.S. stocks in June to the tune of $26.589 billion, after outflows of $1.445 billion in May.Foreigners also bought $99.1 billion in net long-term securities in April, after buying $4.6 billion in May, the report showed.", "Trump's stance on Hong Kong shows his focus on China trade,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,16,2019": "WASHINGTON-- Rather than speak up strongly for the Hong Kong protesters, President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested the answer to their complaints of Chinese oppression is simply for Beijing's \"great leader,\" Xi Jinping, to meet with them and peacefully sort out the unrest that has been decades in the making.Trump's comments were a far cry from the tougher stances taken by some fellow Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and his predecessors in office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to stand with pro-democracy protesters during moments of unrest. His words are emblematic of a foreign policy approach that focuses narrowly on a trade deal with China, putting it above promoting American values.Trump has fixated on the state of trade negotiations and at times has ignored the counsel of some of his most senior advisers to lower the temperature of the trade dispute with Beijing. Amid stock market volatility this week and talk of a looming recession, worries have grown within the West Wing that escalating trade tensions and tariffs could undermine Trump's best argument for reelection -- a strong U.S. economy.In June, Trump indicated to Chinese President Xi on the sidelines of an international summit in Japan that he would not overtly criticize the Chinese government's efforts to silence the protests in Hong Kong, according to two administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions. As the demonstrations ratcheted up this week, Trump stayed mostly quiet, referring to the moment as \"the Hong Kong thing.\"As he has in the past, Trump retreated to the role of observer to an international crisis, chiming in on Twitter with reactions to what he saw on cable TV but not injecting the United States into the moment.He said Thursday before embarking on Air Force One for a rally in New Hampshire that he doesn't want to see the monthslong protests in Hong Kong met with violence by China.National security adviser John Bolton and economic and diplomatic aides have urged the White House to back the protesters.The State Department on Wednesday expressed deep concern about reports of Chinese paramilitary movement near the Hong Kong border and offered a measure of support for the protests, saying they \"reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.\"The top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee jointly placed the blame squarely on Beijing and recalled the violent crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators in 1989.\"We are concerned that China would consider again brutally putting down peaceful protests,\" said the statement Wednesday by Reps Eliot Engel of New York, the committee chairman, and Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican. \"We urge China to avoid making such a mistake, which would be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.\"Other Republicans have spoken out, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, hitting the notes usually associated with a president:\"To the thousands of young people in Hong Kong who are speaking UP for human rights and speaking OUT against the Communist Party of China: we see you waving the American flag, and we hear you singing our national anthem,\" McCarthy tweeted this week. \"America stands for freedom. America stands with Hong Kong.\"Trump took a more active role Thursday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but in an appeal to Xi, whom he has repeatedly flattered and was careful not to criticize. In a tweet, he urged Xi to meet with the protesters to deliver \"a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.\"Meanwhile, the United States and China appear no closer to a trade deal. Despite Trump's claims to the contrary, the pain of the tariffs is being felt by American consumers and businesses, and forcing companies, when possible, to reconfigure their global supply chains.And the talk of recession, perhaps arriving just months before Americans decide if Trump will get a second term, is worrying his advisers. They're concerned that a slowing economy could cause the campaign to shed voters who were willing to give him a pass on some his incendiary policies and rhetoric because the economy has been doing well.Trump, in an interview Thursday with a New Hampshire radio station ahead of a rally in the state, blamed, as usual, any economic sluggishness on his predecessors and on the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates too high. But he also defended his approach to handling China and dismissed the recent stock market tumble.\"We had a couple of bad days, but we're going to have some very good days 'cause we had to take on China,\" the president said. \"It should have been done by Obama and Bush and everybody else. It should have been done long before I came along. But I'm the one that gets stuck with it and I'm the one that's going to do it.\"\"China, frankly, would love to make a deal,\" he continued. \"And it's got to be a deal on proper terms. It's got to be a deal, frankly, on our terms.\"Trump's quiet approach on Hong Kong should not be a surprise. He has repeatedly deprioritized human rights in American diplomacy, from talks with North Korea and Saudi Arabia to China. And he has publicly refused to weigh in on the heavy-handed actions of other nations as he espouses a foreign policy more focused on a narrow view of sovereignty and national interest.The president has repeatedly praised strongmen like leaders in Russia and Turkey for their control over their people and has turned authoritarian tendencies into a punch line.", "U.S. says Taiwan defense spending to rise with China threat,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,15,2019": "TAIPEI--America's top representative in Taiwan said Thursday that Washington expects the island to continue increasing its defense spending as Chinese security threats to the U.S. ally continue to grow.W. Brent Christensen said the U.S. had \"not only observed Taiwan's enthusiasm to pursue necessary platforms to ensure its self-defense, but also its evolving tenacity to develop its own indigenous defense industry.\"That was a nod to President Tsai Ing-wen's drive to develop domestic training jets, submarines and other weapons technology, supplementing arms bought from the U.S.\"These investments by Taiwan are commendable, as is Taiwan's ongoing commitment to increase the defense budget annually to ensure that Taiwan's spending is sufficient to provide for its own self-defense needs,\" Christensen said in a speech. \"And we anticipate that these figures will continue to grow commensurate with the threats Taiwan faces.\"Christensen is the director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which has served as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan since formal diplomatic relations were cut in 1979.While China and Taiwan split during a civil war in 1949, Beijing still considers Taiwan Chinese territory and has increased its threats to annex the self-governing democracy by force if necessary.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, U.S. law requires Washington to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself.Since 2008, U.S. administrations have notified Congress of more than $24 billion in foreign military sales to Taiwan, including in the past two months the sale of 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, valued at $2.2 billion dollars, Christensen said.The Trump administration alone has notified Congress of $4.4 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, he said.China has responded furiously to all such sales and recently announced it would impose sanctions on any U.S. enterprises involved in such deals, saying they undermine China's sovereignty and national security.Tsai has adamantly rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong. She and many Taiwanese have said that the people of the island stand with the young people of Hong Kong who are fighting for democratic freedoms in ongoing protests.Tsai, who says she will seek a second four-year term next year, has said Taiwan was also stepping-up training as it prepared to transition to an all-volunteer force and has raised the defense budget for three consecutive years.China's spending on the People's Liberation Army rose to 1.2 trillion yuan ($178 billion) this year, making it the second-largest defense budget behind the United States.Beijing has cut contacts with Tsai's government over Tsai's refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan is a part of China and sought to increase its international isolation by reducing its number of diplomatic allies to just 17.It has also stepped up efforts at military intimidation, holding military exercises across the Taiwan Strait and circling the island with bombers and fighters in what are officially termed training missions.", "Chinese paramilitary forces exercise near Hong Kong,REUTERS,August,15,2019": "SHENZHEN/HONG KONG--Hundreds of members of China's People's Armed Police could be seen conducting exercises on Thursday at a sports stadium in Shenzhen, as the U.S. State Department expressed concern that they could be deployed across the border in Hong Kong to break up protests wracking the city.But Western and Asian diplomats in Hong Kong said Beijing has little appetite for rolling the PAP or the People's Liberation Army onto Hong Kong's streets.On Thursday men in fatigues could be seen in a stadium and shouts and whistles could be heard. The stadium is next to a retail complex and shoppers were milling around the area, although the entrances to the stadium were closed.Parking spaces at the stadium were filled with more than 100 dark-painted paramilitary vehicles, including troop trucks, armored personnel carriers, buses and jeeps. At least three were armored wheel-loaders, and two vehicles carried water cannons.\"This is the first time I've seen such a large-scale meeting,\" said Yang Ying, a receptionist at a wellness center inside the stadium's retail complex.\"There have been exercises in the past, but usually they involve traffic police,\" she added. \"Our friends, social media all say it's because of Hong Kong.\"Ten weeks of increasingly violent confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.The protests represent one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.On Wednesday the U.S. State Department said it was deeply concerned about reports that Chinese police forces were gathering near the border with Hong Kong and urged the city's government to respect freedom of speech.Troops marched in and out of the Shenzhen stadium, some in fatigues, some in black T-shirts and camouflage trousers. The floor of an indoor area visible through an open gate was lined with mats and rucksacks.Chinese state media have made several mentions of exercises in Shenzhen.The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, published a slick video early this week showing columns of trucks and armored personnel carriers rolling through the city.The paper said the vehicles belonged to the People's Armed Police and had gathered for \"apparent-large scale exercises.\" Its editor, Hu Xijin, described it on Twitter as \"a clear warning to rioters in Hong Kong.\"The Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper said on the social media platform Weibo that the force handles incidents that include riots and terrorist attacks.\"There is usually PAP in Shenzhen, but this time it appears to directed against Hong Kong,\" said a taxi driver, who gave his surname as Wang. \"Usually they wouldn't hold such a big exercise.\"Still, diplomats in Hong Kong said they believe Chinese leadership is well aware that moving mainland forces into Hong Kong would shatter international faith in the \"one country, two systems\" model at the heart of Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub, and would swiftly lead to sanctions.\"We are seeing an escalation in the posturing that appears designed to send messages to both Hong Kong and the mainland ... but we are confident we are still in the realms of propaganda here,\" one senior Western envoy said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \"The trucks aren't about to roll at this point.\"Alexander Neill, a Singapore-based security analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said it would take far more serious scenarios to spark such a move.\"I think we'd really need to see a total breakdown and a sense that China's national interests were at great risk and could not be protected by the Hong Kong government and its police,\" he said.Worst-case scenarios, he said, could involve the assassination or kidnapping of Chinese officials in Hong Kong, the sacking and occupation of key offices there or the government's losing control of parts of the police force.\"We're a long way from anything like that yet, so I think what we are seeing is harder posturing that is part of a much broader propaganda effort underway on many fronts,\" he said.The Shenzhen stadium sits across the water from Hong Kong's rural hinterland, near a bridge straddling the border.People working around the stadium said the level of PAP activity was higher than they had ever seen, but not disruptive, as the troops usually kept to themselves.The chief disruption was PAP vehicles occupying parking spaces, and people who worked in the area said they'd been told not to share pictures of vehicles.", "2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement leader released on bail,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,15,2019": "HONG KONG--A top opposition leader imprisoned on public disorder charges was released on bail Thursday as Hong Kong's government attempts to quell a protest movement that has paralyzed parts of the territory, including its international airport, and led to hundreds of arrests.Benny Tai was sentenced to 16 months as one of nine leaders of a 2014 drive for universal suffrage known as the Umbrella Movement. He was allowed to return home on $12,755 cash bail but barred from leaving Hong Kong.The 2014 movement fizzled, its demands unmet and leaders arrested. However, it laid the groundwork for the new protest movement that began in June with mass opposition to extradition legislation but has since encompassed more sweeping democratic demands.Flights at Hong Kong's airport have mostly resumed after being mass demonstrations and spasms of violence on Monday and Tuesday. Police made five arrests Tuesday night.Those clashes highlighted the hardening positions of pro-democracy protesters and the authorities.While the movement's supporters still have street protests planned, it's unclear what their next move is.More than 700 protesters have been arrested since early June. Police and the government have pledged to bring all \"culprits\" to justice and to take \"relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice.\"Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific said it had canceled 272 flights, affecting more than 55,000 passengers and had fired two pilots in an apparent response to their involvement in activity related to pro-democracy protests. They included one pilot who is \"currently involved in legal proceedings.\" The airline said earlier this week one of its pilots has been charged with rioting after being arrested during a protest.It said the second fired pilot \"misused company information,\" but gave no other details. The Hong Kong Free Press reported the pilot posted a photo of a cockpit screen on an online forum used by protesters.The airport disruptions grew from a summer of demonstrations aimed at what many Hong Kong residents see as an increasing erosion of the freedoms they were promised in 1997 when Communist Party-ruled mainland China took over what had been a British colony.", "Trump suggests trade deal can wait for Hong Kong resolution,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,15,2019": "WASHINGTON--President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that trade talks with China can wait until tensions in Hong Kong have eased, tweeting: \"Of course China wants to make a deal.

Personal meeting?\" Trump tweeted.Trump has previously said little about the protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, except to make it clear he believes that Hong Kong and China need to \"deal with that themselves.\" He has urged the two sides to exercise caution and voiced hopes that the situation will be resolved peacefully.His more extensive comments Wednesday came as U.S. stock markets tumbled, in part because of uncertainty over Trump's trade standoff with Beijing. Investors have also been rattled about the widespread protests in Hong Kong. Flights resumed at Hong Kong's airport after two days of disruptions that descended into clashes with police.While Trump has been reticent to take sides, some Republican and Democratic members of Congress have voiced their support for the protesters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, issued a statement last week saying that \"dreams of freedom, justice and democracy can never be extinguished by injustice and intimidation.\"The demonstrations are against what many Hong Kong residents see as an increasing erosion of the freedoms they were promised in 1997 when Communist Party-ruled mainland China took over what had been a British colony.Trump said he knows Xi well and called him a \"great leader who very much has the respect of his people.\"Trump also voiced optimism about the off-again, on-again trade negotiations with China. Administration officials publicly and privately have voiced beliefs that a trade deal is still a ways off even as the president voices frustration about the lack of progress. Unhappy with the pace of negotiations, Trump announced two weeks ago that the U.S. would apply 10 percent tariffs on about $300 billion in Chinese imports, beginning Sept. 1. But the administration moved Tuesday to delay the tariffs on a wide range of Chinese-made products, including cellphones, laptop computers, some toys, computer monitors, shoes and clothing.

Riot police clashed briefly with the demonstrators, leading to several injuries and prompting at least one officer to draw a handgun on his assailants.The burst of violence included protesters beating up at least two men they suspected of being undercover Chinese agents. Airport security appeared unable to control the crowd, and paramedics later took both men away. Police have acknowledged using \"decoy\" officers, and some protesters over the weekend were seen being arrested by men dressed like demonstrators--in black and wearing face masks.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, identified one of the men as a journalist at the nationalistic Chinese tabloid.\"Fu Guohao, reporter of GT website is being seized by demonstrators at HK airport,\" Hu wrote on his Twitter account. \"I affirm this man being tied in this video is the reporter himself.

The world is watching,\" Gardner said.Cardin was sharply critical of President Donald Trump's failure to take a stronger line on Hong Kong and his characterization of the protests there earlier this month as \"riots\" that were a matter for China to deal with.\"The president has not been clear that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong in protecting their human rights and the autonomy,\" Cardin said. \"It is inconceivable that the president would put the blame on those who are seeking to protect their rights.\"\"The president was wrong to give China an excuse to come down against the protesters,\" Cardin said.Trump, who has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China, said on Tuesday the situation in Hong Kong was tricky but hoped it would work out for everybody, including China, and \"for liberty\" without anyone getting hurt or killed.However, while referring to intelligence reports of Chinese troop movements to the border with Hong Kong, Trump stopped short of warning China of the consequences of intervention.U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned China on Monday that any violent crackdown on protests in Hong Kong would be \"completely unacceptable,\" while Trump administration officials urged all sides to refrain from violence.Cardin said China appeared to be testing how far it could go without repercussions and the U.S. position would be stronger if the president and Congress spoke with a united voice.\"It would have been certainly preferable for the president to speak on behalf of the United States supported strongly by action in Congress,\" he said.The co-sponsor of Cardin's Hong Kong bill, Republican Marco Rubio, has also urged Trump to take a tougher line with China over Hong Kong.\"#China's escalating threats against #HongKong is not an \"internal matter,\" it's a blatant violation of commitment to Hong Kong's autonomy Beijing made in an international treaty\" Rubio tweeted on Tuesday.\"And given their history of repression, Chinese troops massed on border is cause for grave concern,\" he said.The State Department warned in June that any amendment in the Hong Kong extradition law that originally triggered the current round of protests could jeopardize the special status Washington affords the territory.Trump has been silent on the issue but a senior U.S. official said in June Washington might consider sanctions if there was a \"precipitating event,\" such as Hong Kong police being told to stand down and mainland Chinese forces moving in and using violence against protesters.", "Chinese state media urge action, voice support for Hong Kong police after overnight clashes,REUTERS,August,14,2019": "HONG KONG--Chinese state media called on Beijing on Wednesday to deal with protests in Hong Kong more decisively after a reporter from one of China's largest government-backed newspapers was caught up in overnight clashes.Ten weeks of increasingly violent clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters, angered by a perceived erosion of freedoms, are posing one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Demonstrators and riot police clashed at Hong Kong's airport late on Tuesday after flights were cancelled for a second day.

It said protesters could only demonstrate in designated areas.Operations at the city's international airport were seriously disrupted as riot police used pepper spray to disperse thousands of black-clad protesters.Some tourists stopped to look at posters put up by protesters in the airport's arrival hall.\"To do a protest you have to get people's attention. Protests at the airport can let the whole world know what is happening in Hong Kong,\" said Canadian tourist Jason Grafstrom.Check-in operations at the airport were suspended late on Tuesday afternoon, a day after an unprecedented shutdown. Thousands of peaceful protesters had swarmed the arrivals and departures halls earlier on Tuesday, chanting, singing and waving banners.Some protesters used luggage trolleys to blockade the doors to customs checkpoints. Protesters scuffled with police and several police vehicles were blocked amid heated scenes later on Tuesday night, according to witnesses.A policeman was seen drawing his gun at one point.The United Nations human rights commissioner, Michele Bachelet, urged Hong Kong authorities to exercise restraint and investigate evidence that tear gas was fired at protesters in ways banned under international law.China responded by saying her comments sent the wrong signal to what it described as violent criminal offenders.Forward Keys, a flight data company, said the recent wave of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, culminating in the closure of the airport, had deterred people from making plans to visit the city.\"The situation in Hong Kong has deteriorated substantially in the past eight weeks, and particularly so in the past four weeks,\" said spokesman David Tarsh.Long-haul bookings to Hong Kong between June 16 and Aug. 9 were down 4.7 percent from the same period last year, he said.", "Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1 trillion yen export dream for food, forestry items hits snag,By HIROBUMI OHINATA/ Staff Writer,August,13,2019": "The Abe administration is unlikely to meet its 1 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) export goal for agricultural, forestry and fishery products in 2019, figures for the first six months of the year indicate.Exports of the products, including processed foods, increased by 2.9 percent on a year-on-year basis to 448.6 billion yen in the period from January to June.The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced the data on Aug. 9.Exports hit a record high for the seventh straight year, the ministry reported, but due to the slowdown of the world economy they were a far cry from the 15.2 percent growth in the first half of last year.Since domestic demand for food is shrinking in Japan due to the population decline, the government set a goal to raise exports to 1 trillion yen to support the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agricultural industry. Exports were about 450 billion yen in 2012.In 2018, Japanese food products experienced a global boom, and exports climbed to 906.8 billion yen. To meet the government's 1 trillion yen goal, exports would have to rise by 10.3 percent in 2019.However, the export figures for 2019's first half show sluggish exports in key destinations for Japan.Growth in Hong Kong, the top importer of Japanese food products, was just 2.7 percent. It was 17.3 percent in the first half of 2018. Exports to Taiwan fell by 4.4 percent, South Korea by 2.7 percent and Thailand by 6.5 percent.Exports of products popular among the wealthy also dropped from last year. Strawberries fell by 18.7 percent, scallops by 30 percent and apples by 8.9 percent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe economic situation of the countries or regions we export to is definitely hurting our exports,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an MAFF representative said.Factors including the global economic slowdown and the trade dispute between the United States and China appear to have contributed to the fall in Japanese exports.Imports also dropped by 0.4 percent to 4.7488 trillion yen in the first six months of 2019.At the end of 2018, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement and the economic partnership agreement between Japan and Europe took effect. Japanese farmers have been concerned that the trade deals would lower tariffs, causing imports to soar. But beef increased only by 5.3 percent, pork by 2.7 percent, and cheese by 4.9 percent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no tangible effects (from the trade deals),\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hiroyuki Bando, a senior managing director of the Hokuren Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives in Sapporo.The United States, which withdrew from the TPP, asserts that it is put in a disadvantageous position because of the tariffs that favored its competitors, including Australia and Europe.Regarding the ratio of U.S. food items imported on a weight basis in the first half of 2019, pork dropped 1.6 percentage points from the same period of last year to 26.6 percent. Beef increased by 0.4 percentage point to 39.8 percent.", "Hong Kong airport slowly reopens after crippling protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Some flights started taking off again from Hong Kong's airport Tuesday, though more than 100 remained canceled a day after pro-democracy protesters forced one of the world's busiest transport hubs to shut down to highlight their calls for an independent inquiry into alleged police abuse.A few thousand protesters have once more gathered at the airport, where demonstrations were occurring for a fifth day. Thousands took over the facility's main terminal on Monday, leading to the cancellation of more than 200 flights. The central government in Beijing ominously characterized the protest movement as something approaching \"terrorism\" that posed an \"existential threat\" to the local citizenry.Meanwhile, paramilitary police were assembling across the border in the city of Shenzhen for exercises in what some saw as a threat to increase force brought against the mostly young protesters who have turned out in their thousands over the past 10 weeks.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the ongoing instability, chaos and violence have placed the city on a \"path of no return.\"The demonstrators have shown no sign of letting up on their campaign to force Lam's administration to respond to their demands, including that she step down and entirely scrap legislation that could have seen criminal suspects sent to mainland China to face torture and unfair or politically charged trials.While Beijing tends to define terrorism broadly, extending it especially to nonviolent movements opposing government policies in minority regions such as Tibet and Xinjiang, the government's usage of the term in relation to Hong Kong raised the prospect of greater violence and the possible suspension of legal rights for those detained.Demonstrators have in recent days focused on their demand for an independent inquiry into what they call the police's abuse of power and negligence. That followed reports and circulating video footage of violent arrests and injuries sustained by protesters.Some protesters have thrown bricks, eggs and flaming objects at police stations and police said they arrested another 149 demonstrators over the weekend, bringing the total to more than 700 since early June. Police say several officers have suffered burns, bruises and eye damage inflicted by protesters.Lam told reporters Tuesday that dialogue would only begin when the violence stopped. She reiterated her support for the police and said they have had to make on-the-spot decisions under difficult circumstances, using \"the lowest level of force.\"\"After the violence has been stopped, and the chaotic situation that we are seeing could subside,\" Lam said, \"I as the chief executive will be responsible to rebuild Hong Kong's economy ... to help Hong Kong to move on.\"She did not elaborate on what steps her government will take toward reconciliation. After two months, the protests have become increasingly divisive and prompted clashes across the city.The airport shutdown added to what authorities say is already a major blow to the financial hub's crucial tourism industry.Kerry Dickinson, a traveler from South Africa, said she had trouble getting her luggage Tuesday morning.\"I don't think I will ever fly to Hong Kong again,\" she said.The protests early on were staged in specific neighborhoods near government offices. However, the airport protest was had a direct impact on business travel and tourism. Analysts said it could make foreign investors think twice about setting up shop in Hong Kong, which has long prided itself as being Asia's leading business city with convenient air links across the region.Adding to the protesters' anger, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways told employees in a memo that the carrier has a \"zero tolerance\" for employees joining \"illegal protests\" and warned violators could be fired.Hong Kong was promised democratic rights not enjoyed in Communist Party-ruled mainland China when Beijing took over what had been a British colony in 1997, but some have accused Beijing of steadily eroding their freedoms. Those doubts are fueling the protests, which build on a previous opposition movement that shut down much of the city for seven weeks in 2014 that eventually fizzled out and whose leaders have been imprisoned.While China has yet to threaten sending in the army--as it did against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in 1989--the exercises in Shenzhen were a further demonstration of its ability to crush the demonstrations, even at the cost to Hong Kong's reputation as a safe haven for business and international exchange. Images shown on the Internet showed armored personnel carriers belonging to the People's Armed Police driving in convoy Monday toward the location of the exercises just across the border from Hong Kong.The People's Liberation Army also stations a garrison in Hong Kong, which recently released a video showing its units combating actors dressed as protesters. The Hong Kong police on Monday also put on a display of armored car-mounted water cannons that it plans to deploy by the middle of the month.", "China intervention in HK would be \u00e2\u0080\u0098catastrophe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Patten says,REUTERS,August,13,2019": "LONDON--Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last British governor Chris Patten on Tuesday cautioned that if China intervened in Hong Kong it would be a catastrophe and that Chinese President Xi Jinping should see the wisdom of trying to bring people together.Patten said it was counter productive of the Chinese to warn of \"other methods\" if the protests did not stop.\"That would be a catastrophe for China and of course for Hong Kong,\" Patten told BBC radio. \"Since President Xi has been in office, there's been a crackdown on dissent and dissidents everywhere, the party has been in control of everything.\"Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee that under a \"one country, two systems\" mode of governance, the city would retain a high degree of autonomy, an independent judiciary and freedoms not allowed in mainland China.Demonstrations have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades, presenting Xi with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement.Patten said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson should ask U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton who is in London this week to get Washington to agree that it would be a \"catastrophe\" if China was to intervene in Hong Kong.\"I very much hope that even after 10 weeks of this going on, the government and President Xi will see the sense in establishing a way of actually bringing people together,\" Patten said.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday the city's recovery from protests that have swept the Asian financial hub could take a long time and that she would be responsible for rebuilding its economy \"after the violence eases.\"Her comments followed serious developments in the growing crisis over the past week. Beijing said on Monday the protests had begun to show \"sprouts of terrorism\" and the city's airport was closed.\"There is a degree of frustration and anger at the government refusing to give any sensible ground at all which probably provokes more violence,\" Patten said.\"I can't believe that any rational person in Carrie Lam's position would actually argue the case against a commission of inquiry,\" he said.\"What's clearly needed is a process of reconciliation.

Since more than 10 years ago, companies based in Australia and some Asian countries have actively engaged in conducting land transactions there.In principle, Japanese income tax and corporate taxes are not imposed on foreign companies or people who are not living in Japan. However, taxes are imposed on profits reaped by such parties through transactions on real estate in Japan.The Sapporo and Tokyo regional tax bureaus specified the companies involved in real estate transactions in the Niseko area through registration of firms in various countries, information provided by real estate companies and information on the Internet.The bureaus then informed five companies, situated in such regions as Hong Kong, Samoa and the British Virgin Islands, that they failed to declare a total of 1.5 billion yen in income.The authorities also identified two Hong Kong investors that failed to declare a total of about 1.2 billion yen in income, and ordered them to pay 200 million yen in additional taxes.The two individuals are shareholders of an investment firm that was registered in Hong Kong in 2007. The firm sold a forest of more than 10 hectares that it owned in Kutchan to a Singaporean company in 2017.The sales price was about 300 million yen, almost the same as the figure paid by the Hong Kong firm when it purchased the land.At the same time, however, the two also sold shares of the Hong Kong firm to the Singaporean company, reaping profits through the sale.The Sapporo regional tax bureau apparently recognized that profits from the sale of shares in the firm, whose main assets comprise Japanese real estate, were nearly the same as those from the sale of real estate.For transactions of only shares of companies that own land, the registered owners are left unchanged, making it difficult to identify the transactions.The tax authorities also pointed out several Japanese and foreign companies that failed to pay withholding tax.In cases where domestic companies, including foreign firms with branches in Japan, purchased Japanese real estate owned by foreign companies, they have to withhold about 10 percent of the sales prices as taxes that are paid by the sellers. However, several companies failed to do so.According to the Forestry Agency, a total of 223 purchases were made by foreign companies of forested areas during the period from 2006 to 2018, covering 2,076 hectares of land. Of that, 178 purchases, or 80 percent, covering 1,577 hectares were in Hokkaido.\"Ascertaining the moves of foreign companies that made deals in real estate in tourist spots and water-source areas will become a nationwide challenge,\" said a high-ranking National Tax Agency official.Yoshihito Tanaka, 47, a Kutchan town assembly member, said that failures to declare income, which are then uncovered and pointed out by tax authorities, are just the tip of the iceberg.\"I believe there are foreign parties who are trying to escape paying taxes. As a business operator who pays taxes, I feel this cannot be tolerated,\" said Tanaka, who runs a ski rental business and a coffee shop in Kutchan.A licensed tax accountant and former employee of the National Tax Agency said: \"It is quite difficult to identify transactions between foreign companies. In cases where those that should pay taxes are located in foreign countries, tax arrears occur easily. Tax authorities are making efforts to deal with foreigners' transactions, but they are becoming complicated.\"(This article was written by Yuta Hanano and Yasuo Sakuma.)", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xi gets tougher on Trump after new tariff threat,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,13,2019": "BEIJING--Facing another U.S. tariff hike, Chinese President Xi Jinping is getting tougher with Washington instead of backing down.Beijing fired what economists called a \"warning shot\" at Washington by letting its yuan currency weaken in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's latest threat of more punitive import duties on Sept. 1. Chinese buyers canceled multibillion-dollar purchases of U.S. soybeans. Regulators are threatening to place American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list that might face curbs on their operations.Both sides have incentives to settle a trade war that is battering exporters on either side of the Pacific and threatening to tip the global economy into recession. But Xi's government is lashing out and might be, in a revival of traditional Chinese strategy, settling in for prolonged wrangling in response to what it deems American bullying and attempts to handicap China's economic development.Negotiators are to meet in September in Washington, but China's political calendar makes progress unlikely. The ruling Communist Party is preparing to celebrate its 70th anniversary in power on Oct. 1--a nationalism-drenched milestone that puts pressure on Xi, the party leader, to look tough.\"The downside risk of no deal has increased,\" said Raoul Leering, chief trade analyst for Dutch bank ING.Six months ago, Chinese negotiators were discussing possible concessions including more purchases of American farm goods, market opening and changes in business rules. But by May, Chinese leaders had turned skittish in the face of what they saw as constantly shifting American priorities on a list of demands that range from narrowing their trade surplus to opening markets to possibly scrapping their economic development strategy.Talks broke down in May over how to enforce any settlement. Beijing says once it takes effect, Trump has to lift punitive 25 percent tariffs imposed on $250 billion (26 trillion yen) of Chinese imports. Washington insists the tariffs stay to enforce compliance because Beijing has broken too many past promises.The tone of Chinese state media toward Trump, relatively mild to that point, turned nasty. The ruling Communist Party newspaper accused Washington of \"American bullyism.\"\"Good faith broke down and we took many steps backward,\" said Bryan Mercurio, a former Canadian trade official and law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Despite a June agreement by Trump and Xi for more negotiation, neither has shown willingness to compromise. A round of talks in Shanghai last month ended with no sign of progress.Trump says Beijing needs a deal more than he does. On paper, he is right. Their lopsided trade balance means American demand contributes four times as much to Chinese economic activity as China's purchases provide for the United States.But Trump's demand for changes to Beijing's industrial policy strikes at the heart of a development strategy Communist leaders see as the basis of their economic success and a path to prosperity and global influence.That includes initiatives to transform China into a global competitor in profitable technologies through nurturing champions in robotics, electric cars and other fields with subsidies and shielding them from competition.Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Chinese market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Chinese officials retort that they are entitled to develop higher-value industries and have tried to deflect criticism by saying foreign companies might be allowed a role.Chinese leaders insist on \"maintaining their system of economic development. They can't have that crumble,\" said Mercurio.Chinese suspicions deepened when, after the May talks, Trump imposed sanctions on telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd., blocking its access to American technology. Trump cited security concerns but Chinese officials saw an attempt to cripple China's first global tech brand.Washington is \"using improper official measures to suppress Chinese enterprises,\" a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said last week.Xi might feel more confident because, after facing accusations he bungled relations with China's biggest export market, he has strengthened his political position and silenced critics, said Willy Lam, a politics specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.A year ago, Xi felt threatened enough that he was \"anxious to get this over with,\" said Lam. But now, he has gathered support and \"can dig in for the long haul.\"That would mark a return to Beijing's traditional \"war of attrition\" strategy of holding out--for a decade or more, if needed--to get what it wants from the United States, Europe and other partners.China spent 12 years, longer than any other government, negotiating its 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization.Eighteen years later, it still is dickering over terms for joining the Government Procurement Agreement, which extends WTO free-trade principles to official purchases.\"I'm not really surprised that they are doing this,\" said Leering. \"I was more surprised that they had been so low-profile from 2017 onwards, when Donald Trump took office.\"In a sign Beijing might be digging in, two veteran trade envoys--Commerce Minister Zhong Shan and one of his deputies, Yu Jianhua--were added in July to the delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He. Liu is Xi's economic adviser but has little experience in negotiations.The government has told exporters to find new markets and replace American farm goods with imports from Russia, Brazil and other sources.Xi also might be looking to the U.S. political calendar for leverage--a possibility Trump cited when he accused Beijing in July of stalling in hopes he would fail to win re-election next year.Xi might not want to wait that long, because support in Washington for action against Beijing crosses party lines, say political analysts. But they said Chinese leaders might hope as Trump's campaign picks up, he will need a settlement to burnish his status as a trade warrior.\"Trump will want deals to show to the public,\" said ING's Leering. He said without that, Trump's track record of agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea looks \"pretty meager\" for a leader who made trade a cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign.That means \"in the end, the U.S. will be prepared to give in a bit more,\" he said.China also might be holding out for a deal that lets it keep subsidizing technology industries and \"cheating on intellectual property,\" said Lam. That might include retaining leverage to pressure foreign companies to give or license technology at low prices to Chinese competitors.Letting the yuan slide to an 11-year low against the dollar on Aug. 5 reflects another traditional Chinese strategy: Showing an opponent that China can endure painful losses to get what it wants.A weaker yuan would make Chinese exports cheaper abroad and help to offset Trump's tariff hikes. But economists warn a further decline will harm Chinese banks, construction companies and others that have hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign debt by making that more expensive to repay.", "Yen, gold gain on trade war angst; Argentine peso sinks,REUTERS,August,13,2019": "NEW YORK-- Investors piled into gold, safe-haven yen and bonds on Monday over nagging concerns about a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and global growth, while Argentina's peso plunged 15% after voters handed its president an election mauling.The yen rose to its highest in more than a year and a half versus the dollar on the prospect the Japanese currency could gain more in the case of a drawn-out U.S.-Sino trade conflict.Concerns that a trade deal would not be reached before the 2020 U.S. presidential election grew after Goldman Sachs on Sunday became the latest to cut its U.S. growth outlook and warn a trade stand-off would fester past the election.Stocks on Wall Street fell more than 1% to push a gauge of global equity performance down almost as much. Earlier in China stocks rallied more than 1% as the yuan avoided further drama after Chinese authorities allowed the yuan to slip below the seven-per-dollar level last week.Stocks in the near term lack a catalyst either from company earnings, the Federal Reserve or a trade deal, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset Management in New York.\"The promise of a trade deal coming this year, I think that's becoming less and less likely,\" Shah said. \"That does set up the market possibly for a correction at this point,\" he said.Stocks could dip between 5% to 10% but prompt long-term investors to enter the market as valuations fall, he said.

It added that it \"deeply\" regretted the design.\"We also reviewed our assortment to ensure compliance, and have strengthened our internal product development process to avoid the occurrence of a similar issue in the future,\" it said.\"Coach respects and supports China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"The topic \"Coach\" was the hottest item on China's Twitter-like Weibo on Monday morning, receiving 1.2 billion views.Separately, popular Chinese boy band idol Jackson Yee said on Weibo he had severed ties with LVMH's Givenchy after pictures of one of the brand's T-shirts, which also listed Hong Kong and Taiwan in a similar way, received criticism.Givenchy was not immediately available for comment on Monday when contacted by Reuters.Foreign brands are under increasing pressure from Chinese consumers and regulators to fall into line on contentious issues around Chinese sovereignty and its territorial claims.Taiwan is self-governed and has a democratically elected leadership, but China claims the island as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to ensure unification. The question of Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formal independence is one of Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most sensitive political concerns.Beijing is also facing one of its most popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 in Hong Kong, where demonstrators say they are fighting against the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement enshrining some autonomy for Hong Kong when China took it back in 1997.", "Cathay Pacific shares slump after China cracks down on staff protests,REUTERS,August,12,2019": "BEIJING/HONG KONG--Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways fell more than 4 percent to close to a 10-year low on Monday after the Hong Kong flag carrier became caught in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub.Increasingly violent protests since June have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious crisis in decades and are one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Cathay became embroiled on Friday when China's civil aviation regulator demanded the airline suspend personnel who engaged in or supported illegal protests in Hong Kong from staffing flights into its airspace, citing safety concerns.The airline moved fast to comply with the demand from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), suspending a pilot arrested during anti-government protests in Hong Kong and firing two airport employees citing misconduct on Saturday.It also said it would bar \"overly radical\" staff from crewing flights to the mainland, and analysts said the tighter oversight, along with the impact the protests could have on traffic, could affect the airline's bottom line.\"Not only is this likely to affect direct China flights, but also flights to Europe and, to a lesser extent, to the U.S., given that they fly over China airspace,\" Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee said.Passenger traffic in mainland China, Europe and North America accounted for over 50 percent of all Cathay's traffic in the first half of this year, according to Jefferies data.Cathay's shares tumbled to HK$9.82 on Monday morning, their lowest since October 2018 and near levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis.Cathay's largest shareholder is Swire Pacific Ltd, with a 45-percent stake, followed by China's flagship carrier, Air China Ltd which owns 30 percent, according to the airline's latest annual report.The company, which in March reported its first profit in three years, has seen a decline in forward bookings for travel to Hong Kong due to the Hong Kong protests.It was not immediately clear how the regulator's directive would affect flight staffing. Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg told staff the company would report to the CAAC by Thursday on how it would improve flight safety, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.Cathay did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union representing airline employees, has criticized the regulator.In a statement on Saturday, it said the CAAC should have \"respected Hong Kong people's rights and freedoms\" on the basis of the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which guarantees the former British colony a high degree of autonomy from Beijing.", "Hong Kong police demonstrate water cannon as protests linger,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police showed off water cannons Monday as pro-democracy street protests stretched into their 10th week with no sign of either side backing down.The demonstration of specially equipped armored cars came after another weekend of protests at Hong Kong's bustling international airport and on the streets of one of the city's main shopping districts.Legislators and journalists were invited to witness the display of extreme crowd control tactics, which Amnesty International warned last week could lead to serious injuries if misused within Hong Kong's confined spaces.During the weekend protests, website Hong Kong Free Press showed footage of one arrest that appeared to include officers pinning a demonstrator pressed to the ground.

"Hong Kong mops up after weekend of violence, braces for more protests,REUTERS,August,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Metro stations in Hong Kong resumed regular service on Monday and streets were being cleaned of debris as the city recovered from another night of violent clashes between anti-government protesters and police, with more protests planned this week.Police fired volleys of tear gas at protesters across the territory on Sunday and staged baton charges in flashpoints in downtown Hong Kong and in working class districts.Protesters threw two petrol bombs, which police said injured an officer, and used flash-mob strategy, withdrawing when pressed to reappear elsewhere, to combat police.At one stage police stormed some underground train stations, firing tear gas and arresting protesters.The protests blocked multiple roads in key commercial and shopping districts and shuttered public facilities across the Asian financial hub.Protesters are expected to gather at the city's international airport for a fourth day in a row on Monday and plan to rally outside police headquarters on Monday night.The increasingly violent protests since June have emerged as Hong Kong's most serious crisis in decades and become one of the biggest challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.What began as opposition to a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to mainland China to stand trial in Communist Party-controlled courts has evolved into calls for greater democracy in Hong Kong.Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement enshrining some autonomy for Hong Kong when China took it back in 1997. They are calling on the government to listen to public demands particularly an independent investigation into the handling of the protests.Beijing says criminals and agitators are stirring violence, encouraged by \"interfering\" foreign powers including Britain, but the protests seem to enjoy broad support in the city of more than 7 million people.North Korea said late on Sunday it fully supports China on the situation in Hong Kong, which it also said was caused by \"foreign forces\" interfering in an internal affairs of China to encroach on the security and order of the Chinese city.China is the main diplomatic ally and economic benefactor of isolated North Korea, which has been under international sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile development.No country, entity or individual should be allowed to \"destroy the sovereignty and security of China and 'one country and two systems' as Hong Kong is Hong Kong of China,\" the North's foreign ministry spokesman said in comments carried by the official KCNA news agency.Police have arrested more than 600 people since the protests started more than two months ago.", "Tear gas fired in Hong Kong with no end in sight to protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Police fired tear gas Sunday inside a train station and in several other Hong Kong neighborhoods where protesters occupied roads in another weekend of anti-government demonstrations.Protesters hurled bricks at officers and ignored warnings to leave before tear gas was deployed in the Sham Shui Po area, police said, calling a march there an \"unauthorized assembly.\" Nearby, protesters wearing gas masks gathered outside a police station in Cheung Sha Wan, as officers wearing their own protective gear looked down at them from a tall wall around the station.Tear gas was also deployed in central Hong Kong on both sides of Victoria Harbour, in the Tsim Sha Tsui area on the Kowloon side and in Wan Chai on Hong Kong Island. At one point protesters blocked the entrance to a plaza to prevent police from entering. At Tsim Sha Tsui police station, authorities said, one officer was taken to the hospital after he sustained burns on his legs from a petrol bomb thrown by a protester.A train station in Kwai Fong filled with smoke after about a dozen police officers fired tear gas inside. It was not clear how many protesters were inside the station at the time, but it has been rare for officers to fire tear gas indoors.Earlier, a large group of mostly young protesters marched down the middle of Hennessey Road, a main shopping drag in the Causeway Bay area, as a rally was held in nearby Victoria Park. Many wore face masks to shield their identities, and a few had helmets. Others just carried backpacks over the black T-shirts that have become their uniform.\"We hope the world knows that Hong Kong is not the Hong Kong it used to be,\" said one protester, Louisa Ho. \"China is doing more and more to pressure Hong Kong, its people and its organizations.\"Hong Kong has seen nine weeks of protests, with no end in sight. The movement's demands include the resignation of the Chinese territory's leader, democratic elections, the release of those arrested in earlier protests and an investigation into police use of force against the protesters.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" which promises the city certain democratic rights not afforded to people on the mainland. But in recent years, some have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of steadily chipping away at their freedoms.Banners at the rally in Victoria Park read \"Give Hong Kong back to us\" and \"Withdraw the evil law,\" the latter a reference to an extradition bill that was the original spark for the protests. A large crowd sat under umbrellas, which are both a protest symbol in Hong Kong and protection from the summer heat.Hannah Yu, an organizer, said the protest would provide a platform for people to rally peacefully. In what has become an established pattern, groups of protesters have taken over streets or besieged government buildings after largely peaceful marches and rallies earlier in the day.\"There will still be citizens going out on the streets to protest, but we cannot control them and we do not have the authority to control them,\" Yu said.Police permitted the rally in Victoria Park but denied a request by organizers to also have a march in the eastern part of Hong Kong Island. Police also denied permission for the march in Kowloon, but protesters went ahead anyway.In the North Point neighborhood, a former Communist stronghold, brawls broke out throughout the day among a group of unidentified men, journalists and protesters. The men, some carrying Chinese flags, surrounded journalists in neon press vests and yelled at them.Dozens of police stood guard in an attempt to control the situation, which repeatedly descended into scuffles. Newly pasted red banners around the neighborhood declared, \"Protect Hong Kong; Fujianese people rise up to defend the homeland.\" People from China's southern Fujian province rallied Saturday in support of the police.Officers in North Point on Sunday questioned four men dressed in white shirts--the uniform of thugs who injured 44 civilians inside a commuter rail station last month. It was not clear if the four men were arrested.North Point was also the site last week of a fight between wooden pole-wielding men and protesters who defended themselves using makeshift shields and traffic cones.Tiffany Law, a resident of one of the neighborhoods that had clashes, said she came out to help protesters after hearing that many were arrested earlier in the night. She said many area residents did not support the demonstrations.\"But if they see how the police throw all this tear gas, they might understand,\" Law said.", "Hong Kong police and protesters refine battle tactics,REUTERS,August,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police and protesters clashed in cat-and-mouse encounters across the city on Sunday, marking a shift in tactics during a tenth straight weekend of unrest in the former British colony where many are chafing at Chinese rule.Seeking to clear streets more quickly than before, police fired tear gas and charged with batons at flashpoints from big shopping boulevards to bar-lined streets and railway stations.Demonstrators, who at one point lobbed two petrol bombs, retaliated with a flash-mob strategy--withdrawing when pressed, only to re-appear elsewhere relentlessly.The increasingly violent protests since June have plunged the Asian financial hub into its most serious crisis in decades and are one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Despite the intense police response and a toughening stance from China, the movement that began two months ago in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to the mainland still seems to enjoy broad support in the city of more than 7 million people.\"We've been running all day but we're not tired,\" said Ah Sing, a protester in his 30s, wearing a black vest and surgical mask while he rushed from one protest to another.\"This is our response to Carrie Lam,\" he added, referring to the city's Beijing-backed leader. \"If she doesn't listen to the people and respond to our reasonable demands, we're going to continue to spread protests across Hong Kong.\"Beijing says criminals and agitators are stirring violence, encouraged by \"interfering\" foreign powers including Britain.Hong Kong's government called the protests \"unlawful assemblies\" and said a petrol bomb had injured a policeman.There is \"no longer any fixed period of time or fixed locations for these persistent and large-scale illegal and violent acts,\" which have deprived ordinary people of the right to carry on their daily lives, a government spokesman said in a statement.Demonstrators say they are fighting against the erosion of the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement enshrining some autonomy for Hong Kong when China took it back in 1997.\"Independence for Hong Kong is not viable in the near term,\" acknowledged protester Sam, 23, a barrister, while music pumped from cabaret lounges in Wan Chai's bar district behind him. \"But we have to fight for our freedoms and democracy.\"Shortly after, riot police fired volley after volley of tear gas at his makeshift barricade of railings, wood and police cones, forcing protesters to withdraw.\"Why are you hitting my friends? They are teenagers,\" politics student Sabrina, 19, cried out after officers went in with batons at crowds in a shopping district at Kowloon.\"Who are you working for? The Communist Party? The Chinese government? How can you sleep at night?\"Tear gas was also used elsewhere in Kowloon, the main built-up area on the mainland side of Hong Kong harbor, including at an underground transport station and a children's playground.Riot police with truncheons chased protesters into Tai Koo station near the city.Demonstrators avoided confronting pro-Beijing groups, which mobilized at North Point.Authorities have begun emphasizing the damage to the city's economy, already buffeted by China's slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war.They are also applying pressure on big companies like Cathay Pacific Airways, which has been told to suspend staff engaged in illegal protests.Police have arrested more than 600 people.Yet activists' demands have grown to include greater democracy and Lam's resignation. She sought to find a conciliatory tone in a speech to university students on Sunday.\"My colleagues and I will, in the future, be more patient and engage with views from different walks of life, to listen to what's in your hearts,\" she said.Sunday's marches went ahead despite an official ban, with confrontations coming at nightfall.Chants of \"Liberate Hong Kong\" echoed through the working class area of Sham Shui Po when more than a thousand black-shirted protesters marched. Some residents cheered, while drivers honked horns or gave a thumbs-up.\"We have lived in Hong Kong all our lives and this is the hardest time because the government is not listening to the citizens,\" said a 63-year-old man surnamed Leung, who joined a protest with his 93-year-old father in a wheelchair.Hong Kong's government says the protests are pushing the city to an extremely dangerous edge and has refused to open an inquiry into police behaviour.Young people have been at the forefront of the activism.They have dominated a peaceful sit-in at the city's international airport which entered its third day on Sunday, with about a thousand demonstrators singing songs and handing out flyers to arriving travelers amid a carnival atmosphere.\"We want to avoid China completely taking over. If we protesters leave, they will take over immediately,\" said Victor, a 27-year-old art tutor, his face slick with tears from tear-gas smoke near Wan Chai.", "Versace apologies in flap over T-shirts sold in China,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,11,2019": "BEIJING--Italian fashion house Versace has apologized in China for selling T-shirts that it said attached incorrect country names to cities, after a Chinese actress said the clothing was suspected of harming the country's territorial integrity and cut her ties with the company.Versace did not identify the T-shirt in a social media post Sunday, but Chinese media said the item did not list Hong Kong and Macao as parts of China. Both former European colonies were returned to China in the late 1990s.The studio for actress Yang Mi said in an earlier social media post that it had sent a termination notice and stopped all cooperation with Versace.The luxury house said the shirts had been removed from all sales channels on July 24 and destroyed.", "Thousands rally in Hong Kong in fresh protests, marchers defy police ban,REUTERS,August,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of Hong Kong protesters rallied on Sunday, defying a police ban on marches in the Chinese-controlled territory and continuing a restive weekend of demonstrations which saw police fire teargas overnight.Anti-government protests took place in different locations across the Asian financial hub, including one at the city's international airport for a third day.Increasingly violent demonstration have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious political crisis for decades, posing a serious challenge to the central government in Beijing which has taken an increasingly tough line.By Sunday afternoon, over a thousand black-clad protesters peacefully swarmed the airport arrivals hall, chanting \"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time.\"In the city's Victoria Park, thousands of people including elderly and families with children braved sweltering heat to demand authorities listen to the public's demands, particularly an independent inquiry into the government's handling of the crisis and what they say is police brutality.Police said on Sunday they had arrested 16 people during the protests on Saturday for charges including unlawful assembly and possession of an offensive weapon. Authorities have arrested over 600 people since the rallies began in June.Jason Liu, a 29-year-old protester who works as an arborist making sure the city's trees are healthy, said the police made him the most angry as they acted like enemies rather than protecting the people.\"But our main target is obviously the government. They didn't respond to any of our requests.\"The former British colony of Hong Kong is roiling from months of protests that began against a proposed bill to allow people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China and have developed into calls for greater democracy.On Saturday, police fired volleys of teargas to disperse protesters after activists rallied across the city.In the working class district of Sham Shui Po, over a thousand people, including middle aged and elderly marched to protest against the government. Many shops in the area were shuttered.\"We have lived in Hong Kong all our lives and this is the hardest time because the government is not listening to the citizens,\" said a 63-year-old man surnamed Leung, who was accompanied by his 93-year-old father in a wheelchair.There was no police presence at any of the demonstration points in the afternoon and the atmosphere remained jovial and calm, with people even bringing their dogs.Authorities have not given permission for Sunday's two protests planned in Sham Shui Po or North Point, but the rally at Victoria Park was permitted.China has said the central government would not sit idly by and let the situation continue. Hong Kong's government has also said the violence and illegal protests were pushing the city to an extremely dangerous edge.China has also targeted the city's corporate giants, demanding that the city's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend staff involved in the demonstrations.The airline told staff on Saturday it would bar any \"overly radical\" employees from crewing flights to the mainland and said it had removed a pilot who was arrested at protests last week from duty.China has shown strong support for the city's police force with state news agency Xinhua on Sunday stating that 245 representatives from Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations met on Saturday in the city's North Point area to show their support for police.Protesters have increasingly adopted flash tactics, playing a cat and mouse game with police to evade capture.Young people have been at the forefront of recent protests, worried about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, while also concerned with issues such as wealth disparities in the city.Elderly people have also been appearing. On Saturday in two separate protests, small groups of elderly Hong Kongers and families marched near the financial center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business districts. Both marches and the airport protests were peaceful.Several leisure and public facilities have planned to close on Sunday afternoon when the protests are expected.\"I don't care if it is legal or illegal,\" said 18 year old university student Polly.\" We have so many people on our side.\"", "As protesters scatter, Hong Kong residents take their place,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,11,2019": "HONG KONG--After the protesters evacuated, the residents took their place.In one Hong Kong neighborhood on Saturday, riot police fired multiple rounds of tear gas, prompting demonstrators to flee after they started a fire outside a police station and threw eggs at its exterior. But while the pro-democracy protesters left to occupy yet another district, the residents who were watching from the sidelines descended by the hundreds.They watched as officers grabbed a woman who was wearing neither a black shirt nor a mask--the telltale attire of a protester. The crowd surrounded the police and yelled: \"Let her go! Let her go!\"More than two months of mass demonstrations in Hong Kong have given way to routine clashes between protesters and police. As protesters lead police from neighborhood to neighborhood, leaving hastily constructed roadblocks in their wake, residents across the districts have increasingly been caught in the fray.Not all are supportive of the movement, which began in June against an extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the mainland to stand trial. It has since morphed into calls for broader democratic reforms and violent acts of defiance against police, who in turn have been accused of excessive force and deliberate negligence.\"I support them, though I don't agree with all their methods,\" Annie Chan, an accountant, said at a shopping plaza that protesters briefly occupied. \"Most of us middle-aged people understand that the younger generation feels helpless.\"Police used tear gas to disperse protesters who blocked roads and one major cross-harbor tunnel and arrested 16 people for unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and assaulting and obstructing officers.Following a pattern established in past weekends, the demonstrations continued into the night despite police refusal to grant permission for the gatherings.Tear gas was fired at a crowd of some 1,000 people in a brief evening standoff at a commuter rail station in Tai Wai. In a separate incident, police lobbed tear gas at protesters who surrounded a precinct in the Tsim Sha Tsui district on the northern side of Hong Kong's harbor, opposite Hong Kong Island.Earlier marches went ahead in two areas despite a police refusal of permission.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" which promises the city certain democratic rights not afforded to people on the mainland. But in recent years, some have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of steadily chipping away at their freedoms.\"I miss the British colony,\" said protester Alexandra Wong, who carried two British flags and wore a T-shirt that said, \"Establish a Democratic China.\"\"After 1997, young people don't see a future,\" she said.Wong, 73, was among protesters carrying British, Taiwanese or U.S. flags. Some chide them for playing into Beijing's claim that hostile foreign forces are behind the demonstrations.Of those accusations, Wong said: \"I don't care what the government says. They will say anything.\"Demonstrators say they no longer trust authorities after 44 civilians were injured in a mob attack at a commuter rail station last month. The assailants were all dressed in white in an apparent rebuttal to the protesters' trademark black.Police have arrested more than 500 protesters since early June on charges such as unlawful assembly, carrying weapons and rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. On a shopping street Saturday, hundreds of people who appeared to be local residents and passers-by surrounded police officers who arrested a woman. They did not respond to the crowd's questions about why she was being arrested.The angered residents booed and shouted one of the movement's catchphrases: \"Hong Kong police know the law and break the law!\"Earlier in the day, a Hong Kong-based association of people from southern Fujian province gathered around police stations to show their support for law enforcement. They held up large in Chinese flags and signs that read, \"Support the Police Line, Firmly Enforce the Law.\"Also on Saturday, several thousand people continued the second day of protests at Hong Kong's busy international airport. They chanted slogans, set up TV sets to show video of recent protests and handed out leaflets explaining the controversy over the proposed extradition law and demands for universal voting rights.In another district, a group of parents staged a separate march that was approved by police. They called for better protection for children following incidents in which ordinary people have been caught in clashes between police and protesters.\"It's dangerous to bring my child to participate in any protest,\" said Natalie Lee, who was with her 2-year-old daughter. \"Today's march provides a good opportunity for us to bring our children to voice our demands and I hope more peaceful protesters will come out too.\"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam defended her government's handling of the protests in a phone call with Britain's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.The protests have strained Beijing's relations with Britain, which has called on China to honor the terms of their handover agreement and the freedoms its promises.In the call Friday, Lam told Raab that while her government \"respects the diverse views held by members of the public on various issues as well as the freedoms of speech and assembly, it will not let violence and illegal behaviors disrupt public order,\" according to a statement issued by her office.", "Hong Kong police fire tear gas as protesters hit and run,REUTERS,August,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters on Saturday--sending tourists fleeing weeping in Kowloon--only for demonstrators to regroup and gather elsewhere during another tense, hot and restive weekend.Weeks of increasingly violent protests have plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis for decades, posing a serious challenge to China's central government in Beijing.On Saturday activists rallied across the city, with thousands occupying the airport arrivals hall for a second day, while elsewhere police displayed a new willingness to quickly and forcibly clear them from the streets.That became a cat-and-mouse chase with demonstrators late into the summer night.Tear gas was used without much warning shortly after several hundred activists who had marched through Tai Po, in the north of the territory, had barricaded an intersection in the Tai Wai neighborhood around nightfall.They dispersed, as noxious smoke also filled the train station there, bringing train passengers to tears.Then demonstrators popped up again in Kowloon, a large urban district on the mainland side of Hong Kong's harbor, only for police to fire another volley of gas from Tsim Sha Tsui police station, sending nearby tourists running with welling tears.Several other exchanges followed, with protesters, wearing helmets and masks, mostly withdrawing when police fired gas or advanced with shields and truncheons, exhausting authorities and leaving the weeks-long stand-off little closer to resolution.Luxury shops were caught up in the protests, with some shoppers even taking pictures of riot police, while other bystanders--at one stage hundreds--jeered the officers.\"If the government thinks we'll give up and not come out anymore they're wrong,\" said student Chris Wong, 20, at Tai Po.\"Carrie Lam is now spreading lies and blaming us for destroying Hong Kong's economy. But she's the one who is destroying Hong Kong,\" he said. \"We'll continue to fight...but we're also going to be smart and wear them down.\"Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said on Friday the economy--already buffeted by China's slowing economy and the U.S.-China trade war--was being undermined by the protests, which began in June.A government spokesman described the day's demonstrations as \"illegal activities\" that have \"been significantly affecting people's daily lives.\"Demonstrators, most of them young, appeared only to be digging in. Late on Saturday they flashed laser pointers at riot police and lifted bricks and scavenged building materials to barricade roads in Kowloon.China, meanwhile, has also targeted the city's corporate giants, demanding flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend staff involved in the demonstrations--a move which also brought pressure on the airline from mainland businesses.The airline told staff on Saturday it would bar any \"overly radical\" employees from crewing flights to the mainland and said it had removed a pilot who was arrested at protests last week from active duty.Neither warning--one aimed at residents and the other at a business emblematic of the city--deterred demonstrators.Leung Wai Man, a housewife in her 60s, said she had been motivated to march in Tai Po because she was angry about what she saw as the violent response by police at some protests.\"We are very angry about the police over arresting our teenagers,\" she said. She said she was worried about escalating violence, but added that \"the protesters were just trying to protect themselves against police violence.\"More demonstrations are planned on Sunday, including at the working class district of Sham Shui Po, the scene of violent confrontations between activists and police, prompting authorities to plan shutting many public buildings there.The protests began after Hong Kong's government tried introducing an extradition bill that would have allowed defendants to be sent to mainland China for trial.The bill has been suspended, but protesters have stepped up their demands and are now calling for greater democracy and Lam's resignation.Young people have been at the forefront, worried about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, while also concerned with issues such as wealth disparities in the city.Thousands of mostly young activists filled the airport's arrivals hall for a second day, some sitting and shouting slogans, while others drew protest posters and greeted arriving passengers.Older people have also been appearing. Earlier on Saturday, in two separate protests, small groups of elderly Hong Kongers and families marched near the financial center\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business district. Both marches and the airport protests were peaceful.\"We hope to provide a safer place for parents and their kids to participate in rallies, and to voice their concerns,\" said Fion Yim, 35, representative of the organizing committee for what was billed as the family protest.The protests have been condemned by the central government in Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fueling unrest.Hong Kong was guaranteed freedoms not granted in mainland China, including an independent judiciary, under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, when Britain handed it back to China in 1997.Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab on Friday emphasized the right to peaceful protest in a phone call with Lam, prompting a rebuke from China.", "Hong Kong protesters march in defiance of police ban,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters marched in two Hong Kong neighborhoods Saturday in defiance of a ban by police who have clashed repeatedly with government critics.Hong Kong is in its ninth week of demonstrations that began in response to a proposed extradition law but have expanded to include other grievances and demands for more democratic freedoms.Protesters are calling for the resignation of the territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and an investigation into complaints of abuses by police.Police refused permission for two rallies Saturday but they went ahead despite that. Reporters saw officers in riot gear on a road where hundreds of people gathered for one of the rallies.That followed a separate march earlier Saturday, which received police approval, by parents who called for greater protection for children following incidents in which ordinary people have been caught in clashes between police and protesters.Demonstrators complain China's ruling Communist Party and Hong Kong leaders are eroding the liberties promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.Opponents of the proposed extradition law said it would hurt the independence of Hong Kong courts and expose residents to political cases. The government suspended consideration of the proposed law.Beijing has criticized some protesters as violent radicals spurred on by foreign forces bent on containing China's development.For their part, protesters say police have used excessive force and ignored calls for help when thugs attacked civilians in a commuter rail station.Lam defended her government's handling of the protests in a phone call with Britain's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.The protests have strained Beijing's relations with Britain, which has called on China to honor the terms of their handover agreement and the freedoms its promises.In the call Friday, Lam told Raab that while her government \"respects the diverse views held by members of the public on various issues as well as the freedoms of speech and assembly, it will not let violence and illegal behaviors disrupt public order,\" said a statement issued by her office.Also Saturday, several thousand people dressed in black held a sit-in protest for a second day at Hong Kong's busy international airport.They chanted slogans, set up a TV sets to show video of recent protests and handed out leaflets explaining the controversy over the proposed extradition law and demands for universal voting rights.", "U.S. says Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong \u00e2\u0080\u0098dangerous\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,August,10,2019": "WASHINGTON--Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement \"have gone from irresponsible to dangerous\" and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.\"Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,\" Ortagus added in a tweet.She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: \"This must stop.\"On Thursday, Ortagus called China a \"thuggish regime\" for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate's political section.\"I don't think that leaking an American diplomat's private information, pictures, names of their children--I don't think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,\" she told a briefing.The Hong Kong office of China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline \"Foreign Forces Intervene.\"The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children's details were disclosed.In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said \"foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.\"\"China has a long record of broken commitments; it's their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,\" she said.China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon.", "China waiting out Hong Kong protests, but backlash may come,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "BEIJING--China's central government has dismissed Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters as clowns and criminals while bemoaning growing violence surrounding the monthslong demonstrations.That's partly out of concern that protesters' demands for expanded democracy could inspire like-minded officials and intellectuals on the mainland.Yet, Beijing shows no signs of preparing for a major crackdown, content instead to ignore the protests in the hopes that frustration will lead to further violence that will eventually turn the territory's silent majority against the movement, according to experts.\"Hong Kong poses a serious problem for the Chinese government. It can't allow the protesters to challenge its authority or deface symbols of its authority unpunished but it also does not want to attempt a military crackdown,\" said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.Under those circumstances, Beijing would prefer to \"isolate and undermine the protesters so the movement in Hong Kong fizzles out,\" Tsang said.The protests also come at a sensitive time for President Xi Jinping, who after removing presidential term limits last year effectively made himself leader for life. That has intensified criticism over his concentration of power, even as his propaganda machine relentlessly promotes his image and achievements ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1.Meanwhile, China is grappling with a slowing economy and the ongoing impacts of the U.S.-China trade war, as well as pushback against its ambitious multi-billion dollar \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure program that is seen as miring poorer nations in debt.China's international image has suffered as well from its mass incarceration of members of its Uighur Muslim minority and aggressive moves in the foreign policy sphere, including what professor Anne-Marie Brady of New Zealand's University of Canterbury described in a recent article as \"uncharacteristically undiplomatic activity\" by Chinese diplomats in Canada, Sweden, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.China's activities have included encouraging mainland Chinese students overseas in their attacks on supporters of the Hong Kong protests and Chinese human rights more generally, sparking calls from politicians in those countries for foreign policy adjustments to reduce Beijing's influence.Despite massive Chinese censorship, details of the events in Hong Kong have spread through southern China and among officials and intellectuals in major cities, raising concerns about potential calls for political freedoms like those enjoyed by Hong Kong.\"Beijing fears there might be a copy-cat effect in other cities in China,\" said Willy Lam, a longtime observer of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Attacks on police stations and symbols of Chinese authority and displaying disregard for the law are seen as \"potentially very dangerous\" because they challenge the legitimacy of Beijing's rule in Hong Kong under the \"one country, two systems,\" Lam said.At the same time, many Hong Kongers believe China has broken its promise to allow Hong Kong a high-degree of self-rule, driving protesters to rebel, Lam said. Beijing, he said, is seen as no longer having a \"valid legitimacy to rule Hong Kong.\"The refusal to offer concessions or even open a dialogue with the protesters creates a \"vicious circle\" whereby those in the movement have no choice other than to continue demonstrating or tow Beijing's line, said Joseph Cheng a political analyst now retired from the City University of Hong Kong.\"There's no prospect for reconciliation. It's now a contest of wills,\" Cheng said.And while Beijing condemns the violence, violence is \"precisely what it is hoping for\" in the expectation that frustrated protesters will provide more images of melees and fire bombings that will alienate the general population, Lam said.However, one tactic Beijing is highly unlikely to use is deploying its military, as was used with deadly effect against pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, the last time the party saw such open defiance of its authority on the streets of a Chinese city.Deploying the People's Liberation Army would be an \"irrevocable and fateful decision, which would have devastating consequences for Beijing,\" Lam said. \"China would lose face internationally because, after 20 years of Chinese rule, not only has Beijing failed miserably to win hearts and minds, but it now has to use brute force to enforce its will.\"Such a move would have an equally devastating effect on Hong Kong's economy, possibly causing the local stock market that is key to funding the Chinese economy to crash and prompting a mass outflow of foreign investors and capital.Based on Beijing's fiery rhetoric, the numbers of arrests already made and the range of charges being brought--including rioting, which carries a potential 10-year prison sentence--Lam said the authorities are likely to come down much harder than after 2014 demonstrations.\"They hope to use those charges to serve as a warning, but so far the protesters have not been cowed,\" Lam said.Lam and others also expect Beijing to double down on what it terms patriotic education in an attempt to inculcate love and respect for the Chinese state. That will include more lessons on patriotism in the school curriculum, more spending on free tours of key sites in mainland China glorifying the party and economic inducements such as the offer of high-paying jobs in the Pearl River Delta surrounding Hong Kong.Though it's unclear such efforts will succeed, China has the determination and virtually unlimited funds to make young Hong Kongers \"patriotic Chinese citizens,\" Lam said.\"Ultimately, they hope people will just keep their heads down and focus on making money,\" Cheng said. \"But these issues are not resolved and there is a strong chance (a protest movement) will rise again.\"", "Pro-democracy activists protest at Hong Kong airport,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "HONG KONG--Pro-democracy activists rallied at Hong Kong's airport Friday even as the city sought to reassure visitors of their welcome despite the increasing levels of violence surrounding the 2-month-old protest movement.The government concedes road blockages and confrontations between police and protesters have caused inconveniences, but says they were limited to specific areas. The protests, however, were not abating, and more are planned for this weekend, including at the airport, where protesters holding signs staged a sit-in at the arrival and departure halls Friday.Police said they had not received a formal application for the airport protest and warned against violence or disruptions that could endanger public safety. They said they were considering applications for weekend marches elsewhere.Signs held by protesters in the arrival hall included those saying \"There are no rioters, only tyranny,\" while pamphlets stacked in piles warned visitors of the heavy use of tear gas by police. Officers said 800 canisters were used during protests on Monday alone, and journalists and protesters say many suffered skin irritation and internal injuries as a result.While the airport appeared to be operating normally, extra identification checks were put in place for both travelers and staff, and airlines were advising passengers to arrive earlier than usual for check-in.A similar airport protest on July 26 ended peacefully, and there was no indication Friday that police planned to use force to end what was planned as a three-day demonstration.At a briefing, officer Vasco Williams said the force did not plan to issue an outright ban on demonstrations but would gauge each application based on the ability of organizers to maintain order.\"The police will closely monitor the situation this weekend and make respective deployment as necessary. It will be dependent on what happens at the time,\" said Williams, who is operations superintendent for the district of New Territories North.However, Williams and three other senior officers present at the briefing repeatedly declined to answer questions about police tactics, including the alleged use of expired tear gas canisters, or the recall from retirement of former Deputy Commissioner Lau Yip-shing.Lau oversaw the response to pro-democracy protests five years ago in which police were accused of using excessive force. He began serving in the specially created temporary post of deputy commissioner of police for special duties on Friday.Police testing of water cannons for possible use against protesters has also drawn concern, with Amnesty International issuing a statement calling for \"extreme caution\" in any such deployment. Along with tear gas, police have used rubber bullets, sponge-tipped grenades, and beanbag rounds.\"The use of these powerful weapons in the city's densely populated streets could cause serious injuries and further enflame tensions,\" Amnesty said. Police actions so far raise questions as to whether police officers can \"use water cannons in a way that doesn't put people at risk of serious injury,\" the group said.A Hong Kong government statement referring to the travel safety warnings issued by 22 countries and regions appeared to acknowledge the potential for the protests to devastate the territory's crucial travel industry. The statement said the government and the travel industry were working to minimize disruptions and \"all stand ready to welcome and assist visitors to Hong Kong any time.\"The government on Thursday said tourist arrivals dropped 26% at the end of last month compared to last year and were continuing to fall in August. The travel industry accounts for 4.5% of the financial hub's economy and employs about 2500,000 people, or about 7% of the total working population.The impact could be as bad or worse than occurred during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Travel Industry Council Chairman Jason Wong Chun-tat was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post. Wong said cancellations could see hotel revenues in August drop by 40% against the same period last year.Sparked two months ago by proposed extradition legislation that could have seen suspects sent to mainland China--where protesters say they could face torture and unfair politicized trials--the protests have since morphed into calls for broader democratic reforms in the former British colony, along with the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and investigations into alleged police abuse.Hong Kong police say 592 people have been arrested since June 9, ranging in age from 13 to 76. They face charges including rioting, which allows for prison terms of up to 10 years, along with interfering with police duties and taking part in unauthorized gatherings.Demonstrators have at time attacked with metal sticks, bricks, gasoline bombs and carts full of burning debris, while on several occasions, protesters have been attacked by unknown people believed to be linked to organized crime groups.", "China orders Cathay Pacific to suspend staff backing Hong Kong protests,REUTERS,August,10,2019": "HONG KONG/BEIJING--China's aviation regulator on Friday demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways suspend personnel who have engaged in illegal protests in the city from staffing flights into its airspace from August 10.Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent anti-government street protests for the past two months, which a top Chinese official described this week as the greatest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Last week, a Cathay pilot was among over 40 people charged with rioting for allegedly taking part in violent clashes with the police near Beijing's main representative office in the city.On Friday night, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said that Cathay crew who have engaged in the protests pose a threat to aviation safety in mainland China, according to a statement on its website.The aviation authority ordered Cathay to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights.Crew members that have not gained the authority's approval will not be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations.The airline has also been ordered to draw up proposals to strengthen safety and security, said the statement.In response, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson said: \"We have received the directive and are studying it very carefully. We are treating it seriously and are following up accordingly.\"\"The safety of our passengers is always the top priority of Cathay Pacific. There is zero tolerance for any inappropriate and unprofessional behavior that may affect aviation safety. We deal with these incidents very seriously.\"Cathay said on Thursday it respects \"everyone's right to express themselves in a peaceful and respectful manner,\" while insisting it \"recognizes that Hong Kong SAR is a part of China.\"\"We do not condone any activities that jeopardize the stability of Hong Kong,\" it said.On Monday aviation workers joined a strike that gridlocked Hong Kong, forcing airlines, including Cathay, to cancel hundreds of flights.Responding to a question on the protests at a press conference earlier this week, Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company respects its staff's opinions.\"We certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something. They're all adults, they're all service professionals. We respect them greatly,\" he said.Global Times, published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, ran news stories this week highlighting Cathay employees' participation in the ongoing protests.Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on Friday urged an end to the violence, claiming that the protests are dragging on the city's economy.Hong Kong-listed Cathay is 45% owned by Swire Pacific and 22.7% held by Air China , according to Refinitiv Eikon.The airline has been Hong Kong's flag carrier since the colonial era. Swire Pacific's parent, John Swire & Sons Ltd, is a UK-based conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to transportation.", "IMF contradicts Trump: China not manipulating its currency,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,10,2019": "WASHINGTON--The International Monetary Fund sees little evidence that China's central bank has deliberately reduced the value of the nation's currency--a position at odds with the Trump administration's decision this week to accuse Beijing of manipulating the yuan.The IMF said Friday in its yearly review of China's economy that the yuan has been \"broadly stable\" against other currencies, suggesting there's been little intervention by the People's Bank of China. A weaker yuan would give Chinese exporters a competitive price advantage over foreign rivals.The Treasury Department on Monday named China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994. The move, reversing its decision in May to keep China off the blacklist, came after Beijing's central bank let the yuan drop to its lowest point in 11 years.\"Clearly, they are manipulating their currency,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC Friday.China's central bank sets the exchange rate each morning and allows the yuan to fluctuate by 2% against the dollar during the day. The central bank can buy or sell currency--or order commercial banks to do so--to keep the yuan's price from swinging too widely.In letting the yuan slide, the central bank was responding to economic reality. China's economy is slowing--partly because President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports--and market pressures are pulling the currency down.The world's two largest economies are locked in a tariff war over U.S. allegations that China is stealing trade secrets and forcing foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology. Twelve rounds of talks have failed to end the impasse, and a Chinese delegation is expected in Washington next month to continue the negotiations.But Trump rattled financial markets Friday by saying it would be \"fine\" with him if talks got called off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 90.75, or 0.3%, to 26,287.44, and the Nasdaq dropped 80.02, or 1%, to 7,959.14.", "Huawei unveils phone system that could replace Android,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,9,2019": "BEIJING--Huawei on Friday unveiled a smartphone operating system that it said can replace Google's Android, adding to the Chinese tech giant's efforts to insulate itself against U.S. sanctions.The announcement of HarmonyOS highlights the growing ability of Huawei, the No. 2 global smartphone brand and biggest maker of network gear for phone carriers, to create technology and reduce its reliance on American vendors.U.S. curbs imposed in May threatened Huawei's smartphone sales by limiting access to Android and blocking Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., from supporting music and other services based on the system.Huawei Technologies Ltd. wants to keep using Android, Richard Yu, CEO of its consumer device unit, said at a conference for software developers in the southern city of Dongguan.\"However, if we cannot use it in the future we can immediately switch to HarmonyOS,\" Yu said. He said that could be done in as little as two days if needed.Huawei, China's first global tech brand, is at the center of a battle between Washington and Beijing over the ruling Communist Party's ambitions to develop companies that can compete in robotics and other fields.The Trump administration says Beijing's efforts are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology. Washington and other trading partners say the Chinese campaign violates its free-trade obligations.Washington has labeled Huawei a security threat, an accusation the company denies. Some officials also see the rise of Huawei and other Chinese tech competitors as a potential threat to U.S. industrial leadership.Huawei spends about $12 billion (1.2 trillion yen) a year on U.S. semiconductor chips and other components. The company said the U.S. export curbs might cut its projected sales by $30 billion over two years.Since then, authorities have said vendors will be allowed to supply technology that is available from other sources. That came after American technology suppliers warned they would be hurt by the loss of one of their biggest customers.Huawei also has developed its own chipsets for low-end smartphones and servers, though it still needs U.S. vendors for its most advanced products.Yu said Huawei's first smartphone using HarmonyOS would be released Saturday under its Honor brand.Huawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, reported earlier its smartphone shipments rose 24 percent in the first half of 2019 over a year ago to 118 million units.\"We could have done better, but due to the challenges we face in the international market, our shipments dropped a bit,\" Yu said.Huawei reported that sales in the six months through June rose 23.2 percent over a year earlier to 401.3 billion yuan ($58.3 billion). That was up from 2018 growth of 19.5 percent, but Chairman Liang Hua warned Huawei will \"face difficulties\" in the second half.Liang said then that Huawei was reviewing its product lineup to make sure it could fill orders without U.S. components if necessary.On Friday, Yu said HarmonyOS is designed to operate on PCs and tablet computers as well as smartphones, allowing users to integrate music and other functions across multiple devices.HarmonyOS will be open source to allow outside developers to contribute to its development, Yu said.\"We want to build a global operating system, so it will not be used by Huawei alone,\" he said.", "Malaysia files charges against 17 Goldman Sachs unit directors,REUTERS,August,9,2019": "KUALA LUMPUR--Malaysia has filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a multibillion-dollar corruption investigation at state fund 1MDB, the attorney general said on Friday.Goldman Sachs has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise $6.5 billion (698 billion yen) through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the subject of corruption and money laundering investigations in at least six countries.Friday's charges were brought under a section of the Malaysian Capital Markets and Services Act that holds certain senior executives responsible for any offenses that may have been committed, Attorney General Tommy Thomas said.\"Custodial sentences and criminal fines will be sought against the accused ... given the severity of the scheme to defraud and fraudulent misappropriation of billions in bond proceeds,\" Thomas said in a statement.The individuals charged include Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International and Michael Sherwood, former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs international, Thomas added.Goldman Sachs said the charges were misdirected.\"We believe the charges announced today, along with those against three Goldman Sachs entities announced in December last year, are misdirected and will be vigorously defended,\" a Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong told Reuters.The bank has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs, outside counsel and others about the use of transaction proceeds.Last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs and two of the U.S. bank's former employees in connection with 1MDB. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the bank for its role as underwriter and arranger of the bond offer.An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has said.Tim Leissner, a former partner of Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty last August to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then Prime Minister Najib Razak.Najib, ousted in an election last year, is facing dozens of criminal charges related to 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.", "Protesters throng Hong Kong airport as others urge calm,REUTERS,August,9,2019": "HONG KONG--Demonstrators crowded the arrivals hall at Hong Kong airport on Friday, handing out anti-government leaflets and waving banners in a dozen languages in an effort to raise awareness among visitors ahead of a weekend of protests planned across the city.Several hundred protesters, mostly young and wearing black T-shirts, gave out flyers headlined \"Dear travelers\" above artwork depicting the months-long protests that have plunged the financial hub into its biggest crisis since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\"Please forgive us for the 'unexpected' Hong Kong,\" the English leaflets read. \"You've arrived in a broken, torn-apart city, not the one you have once pictured. Yet for this Hong Kong, we fight,\" the flyers said.The increasingly violent protests also pose one of the gravest populist challenges yet to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.What started as an angry response to a now-suspended law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in Chinese courts has grown to include demands for greater democracy, the resignation of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, and even keeping out mainland tourists.The airport demonstration came as the city's powerful property developers spoke out for the first time, urging calm after a dozen big companies warned in recent days that the unrest had dented earnings.\"The Hong Kong community has been suffering from the acts of violence perpetrated by a small group of individuals lately,\" said a statement signed by 17 developers, including Henderson Land Development, New World Development 0017.HK, and Sun Hung Kai Properties.\"Such acts have deviated from the original intent of the peaceful demonstrations and are bringing distress to the business community and the general public as a whole,\" it said.There was no sign of a police presence at the airport early on Friday afternoon.\"It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,\" one protester, Charlotte Lam, 16, told Reuters.\"We have made stickers, banners in over 16 languages, ranging from Japanese to Spanish. We want to spread our message internationally. We are not rioters, we are a group of Hong Kongpeople fighting for human rights and freedom,\" she said.Hong Kong has recalled from retirement a police commander who oversaw the response to pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 to help deal with the latest protests, suggesting a lack of confidence in the current leadership.Former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing will handle large-scale public order events, including activities to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, the government said in a statement.The escalating violence has already prompted travel warnings from countries including the United States and Australia, although the airport demonstration did not draw complaints from some travelers.\"I don't really know what to think about the protest down there,\" said a woman from New Zealand who gave her name as Joyce.\"Right now I just hope it won't delay my flight. But at the same time, as long as you're making a point without making too much trouble, it's OK I guess,\" she said.A Taiwanese man named Daloy, 32, welcomed the demonstrators even though his flight was canceled.\"I think this is more important, because today it's Hong Kong and tomorrow it will be Taiwan,\" he said. \"We are also in a dangerous situation.\"The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement on Thursday it supported the stance of Zhang Xiaoming, one of the most senior Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs.Zhang said during a meeting in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen this week Hong Kong was facing its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. He said the central government must intervene if \"turmoil\" occurs in Hong Kong.", "More Hong Kong protests planned as U.S. ups travel warning,REUTERS,August,8,2019": "HONG KONG--The United States raised its travel warning for Hong Kong, urging increased caution by visitors to the Chinese territory in the face of what it described as civil unrest after months of sometimes violent street protests.The protests in the Asian financial hub began with opposition to a now-suspended extradition law and have evolved into a direct challenge to the city's government and calls for full democracy.\"The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies,\" said the advisory, posted on the website of the U.S. state department on Wednesday.\"These demonstrations, which can take place with little or no notice, are likely to continue,\" it added. The advisory was raised to level two on a four-point scale.Australia also warned its travelers in an updated advisory.The protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with a debilitating trade war with the United States and a slowing economy.Hong Kong is facing its worst crisis since it returned to China from British rule in 1997 because of the protests, the head of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office has said.More protests are planned in several districts across the city this weekend, starting on Friday, with demonstrators also planning a three-day rally at the city's international airport.Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam visited Hong Kong districts on Wednesday to speak with residents and inspect a police station that had been the target of recent protests.The government would put forward measures to improve people's livelihoods, she said in a statement after the visit.Young people have been at the forefront of the protests, angered by broader problems, such as sky-high living costs and what they see as an unfair housing policy skewed towards the rich.The normally efficient and orderly city has seen its transport network besieged and shut down by demonstrators, while protests have also shut big-brand stores and popular shopping malls.Hong Kong police have arrested 589 people since the protests began in June, the youngest aged 13.Three masked activists, who did not give their names, held a second news conference on Thursday, broadcast on domestic television channels, to discuss what they called abuse of power by the police.\"The continuation of such attempts at spreading fear and suppressing the freedom of press will eventually backfire on the government itself,\" one activist told the Citizens' Press Conference, a platform protesters are using to voice concerns over the situation in Hong Kong.\"The ultimate victim of these tactics will be the police force's crumbling public image,\" added the activist, who spoke in English.The comments came after plainclothes police arrested a student leader from Baptist University on the grounds that laser pointers he bought were offensive weapons.Several thousand Hong Kong lawyers, dressed in black, marched in silence on Wednesday to call on the government to safeguard the independence of the city's department of justice.They fear the justice department's prosecutions of arrested protesters are taking on an increasingly political slant. Many of those arrested have been charged with rioting, which carries a 10-year jail term.Protesters have started to use increasingly diverse tactics to evade capture, shifting quickly from place to place and using online platforms such as Telegram to direct hundreds of people.They also circulated brightly colored pamphlets online ahead of the airport demonstrations, aiming to help tourists understand events, in which they vowed never to surrender.\"Dear travelers, please forgive us for the 'unexpected Hong Kong'. You're arrived in a broken, torn-apart city, not the one you have once pictured. Yet the city you imagined is exactly what we are fighting for,\" the pamphlets said.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yuan weakens after signs of stability calm markets,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,8,2019": "BEIJING--China's currency weakened again Wednesday after hopes among financial traders that its decline was stabilizing helped to calm jittery global markets.The yuan edged down to 7.0488 to the U.S. dollar, about 0.4 percent below its level late Tuesday. The currency strengthened slightly to 7.0443 to the dollar in the afternoon but still was below the previous day's level.Financial markets tumbled after Beijing allowed the yuan to fall Monday to an 11-year low against the dollar, breaking through the politically sensitive level of seven to the U.S. currency. Washington responded by declaring officially that China improperly manipulates its exchange rate, opening the way for possible sanctions.On Tuesday, central bank officials told foreign companies \"the yuan will not continue to depreciate sharply in the future,\" the bank press office said in a statement. It gave no details but said \"two-way fluctuation\" of the currency \"will become the norm in the future.\"Tension over currency adds to a sprawling U.S.-Chinese fight over Beijing's trade surplus and technology policies that companies and investors worry will chill global growth.The yuan's moves over the past week are small compared with fluctuations of the euro and other major currencies. But Washington complains the yuan is too weak, making China's export prices unfairly low and swelling its trade surplus. That makes any decline politically volatile.The People's Bank of China sets the yuan's exchange rate each morning and allows it to rise or fall 2 percent during the day. It can intervene and buy or sell currency--order Chinese commercial banks to do so--to guide the exchange rate.The bank lowered the opening level for trading Tuesday, but traders were encouraged when it was slightly higher than they expected. That, plus a central bank statement late Monday promising to keep the currency stable, helped to stabilize financial markets.On Wednesday, the central bank lowered the starting point for trading again, setting it at 6.9996 to the dollar, almost 0.5 percent below Tuesday's starting level. That would allow the yuan to slide to below 7.1 to the dollar while staying within the trading band.Officials told companies the slide will stop, \"but they haven't seen that today,\" said Chris Weston of Pepperstone in a report. \"This is again proving central to moves across markets in Asia.\"Stock market benchmarks in Tokyo and Shanghai closed down 0.3 percent. Seoul lost 0.4 percent.The Chinese central bank showed it can \"steer global markets\" and \"quickly weaken\" the yuan if needed to offset U.S. tariff hikes, Stephen Innes of Oanda said in a report.\"This is about China proving a point,\" Innes said. \"They have a brawny tool at their disposal.\"U.S. President Donald Trump's punitive tariffs on Chinese products have added to downward pressure on the yuan by prompting concern about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.Last week, Trump stepped up their fight by threatening to hike tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1.That came after the latest round of talks aimed at ending the tariff war concluded in Shanghai with no sign of a deal. Negotiators are due to meet again in September in Washington.Economists say if the Sept. 1 tariff hike goes ahead, the dent in Chinese exports and economic growth could weaken the yuan to as low as 7.2 to the dollar.A weaker yuan might lead to an outflow of capital, raising borrowing costs at a time when Chinese leaders are trying to shore up cooling economic growth. That would add to downward pressure on the exchange rate.On Wednesday, the latest central bank data on China's foreign currency reserves suggested regulators did little buying or selling in July to manage the exchange rate. The reserves declined by a small margin of $15.5 billion in July to just over $3.1 trillion.Since then, however, \"capital outflows have almost certainly picked up,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard and Martin Lynge Rasmussen of Capital Economics in a report. \"There are signs that this has already encouraged the PBOC to step-up intervention to manage the pace of depreciation.\"", "China warns Hong Kong facing biggest crisis since handover,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,8,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong is facing its \"most severe situation\" since its handover from British rule in 1997 following weeks of demonstrations and the central government is considering what measures to take next, the head of Beijing's Cabinet office responsible for the territory said Wednesday.Zhang Xiaoming was speaking to Hong Kong residents attending a seminar in the mainland city of Shenzhen just across the border from the Asian financial hub that has been wracked by daily protests against the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.Those protests are getting increasingly violent and having \"an increasingly broad impact on society,\" Zhang told the 500 attendees, who included members of the Hong Kong and central government legislative and advisory bodies.\"It can be said that Hong Kong is facing the most severe situation it has faced since the handover,\" Zhang said.Officials in Beijing were \"highly concerned\" and studying the situation to decide on measures to take, he said.Hong Kong was returned to China under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised the city political, civil and economic freedoms not allowed under Communist Party rule on the mainland.However, many Hong Kong residents feel Beijing has been increasingly encroaching on their freedoms. The protests were set off by proposed extradition legislation that if passed would have allowed some suspects to be sent to China, where critics say they could face possible torture and unfair trials.China so far has not visibly intervened in the situation, though in editorials and statements from officials it has condemned demonstrators and protest organizers as criminals, clowns and \"violent radicals\" and alleged that they have been inflamed by politicians from the United States, Taiwan and elsewhere.Speculation that the military could be deployed grew after Chinese officials pointed to an article in Hong Kong law that allows troops already stationed in the city to help with \"public order maintenance\" at the Hong Kong government's request.Hong Kong authorities have said they don't anticipate any need to bring in troops or police from China to help impose order. Observers say Beijing will likely try to wait the protesters out, hoping rising violence and inconvenience will turn the tide of public opinion against them.Lam reappeared Wednesday at the opening of an exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state.\"Over recent months, conditions in Hong Kong society have been extremely unstable,\" Lam said in remarks distributed by her office. \"The special administrative region government will certainly join with all of you to deal with it calmly, restore social order, safeguard rule of law and cherish Hong Kong, cherish 'one country, two systems,' and cherish our home.\"Pro-democracy lawmakers continued to criticize Lam's handling of the protests. Claudia Mo told reporters that Beijing and Lam were employing a two-pronged strategy of using the police force to handle the protesters physically while also attacking them ideologically by labeling their movement as seeking to destroy the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\"We all know this (Hong Kong) administration has become completely untrustworthy and this is just so sad for Hong Kong,\" Mo said.With Hong Kong's crucial travel industry suffering as tourists put off their visits, Australia became the latest country to issue a travel safety warning to its citizens.Australians should \"exercise a high degree of caution,\" in Hong Kong, the notice said. It said there was a risk of violent confrontation between protesters and police, or \"criminally linked individuals,\" and visitors should avoid large gatherings, especially at night and on weekends.Ireland, Britain and Japan have already issued Hong Kong travel warnings.Protesters have come from all professions and age groups. On Wednesday, several hundred lawyers sought a meeting with Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng and staged a silent protest. The authorities have refused to open a dialogue with protesters and there was no immediate response from Cheng's office.Margaret Ng, a lawyer and a former lawmaker, said they wanted to meet Cheng and the director of public prosecution to seek an assurance that there was no political motive in prosecution of those detained in the protests.More than 500 people have been arrested since the protests began in June and dozens have already been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\"One of the most important things about the rule of law is prosecution must not be abused because if abused, it is the most powerful instrument of oppression,\" Ng said.She and other lawyers urged protesters to avoid violence that could harm their cause.Lawyer Dennis Kwok said government warnings of stern measures against protesters will merely flame the people's anger. He called for an independent investigation into the actions of police and protesters.Another Chinese official said Tuesday that it would be \"only a matter of time\" before those behind the protests are punished, further indicating that Beijing will take a hard line against the demonstrators and has no plans to negotiate over their demands for political reforms.\"We would like to make it clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: Those who play with fire will perish by it,\" said Yang Guang, spokesman for the Chinese Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.At a daily briefing Wednesday, police spokesman Tse Chun-chung condemned members of a crowd of around 1,000 who the night before surrounded a police station to demand the release of a university student arrested for apparently buying laser pointers.He said police fired 20 tear gas canisters to clear the demonstrators from the blue-collar Sham Shui Po neighborhood. A total of 589 people have been arrested in the protests ranging in age from 13 to 76, Tse said.They include people caught in possession of laser pointers, which are classified as offensive weapons because of their ability to harm the eyes.", "China suspends mainland movies, stars from Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards,REUTERS,August,7,2019": "BEIJING/TAIPEI--China's film regulator on Wednesday said it was blocking the mainland movie industry from participating in Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards without a giving a reason, in the latest sign of rising tensions between Beijing and the self-ruled island.The China Film News, a magazine published by the China Film Administration, made the announcement on its official WeChat account.\"China Film Administration says that it will suspend mainland movies and their personnel from participating in 2019' 56th Golden Horse Awards,\" said the post.The move comes after the annual event, the Chinese-speaking world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version of the Oscars, last year became a lightning rod for questions about Taiwanese independence, sparking a debate between Taiwanese and mainland stars as well as netizens.The state of ties between Beijing and the self-ruled island has since become more tense, with China announcing that it would stop issuing individual travel permits for Taiwan to Chinese travelers last week, dealing a blow to the island's tourism industry.\"We certainly would feel regret if it was true,\" Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival said in a statement, adding that related events will be held as scheduled.Beijing has been using the international stage to assert its sovereignty over the island amid rising Chinese pressure, which also includes military drills. Taipei repeatedly said the Chinese moves were aiming to manipulate the island's presidential elections in January.\"From an industry point of view, the Golden Horse was a good platform for exchanges on films among mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong,\" said Dong Shu, a Shanghai-based film critic.\"But some people in Taiwan had to get politically sensitive content on it, things that crossed red lines for mainland China, thus the nature of this award has been changed.\"The Golden Horse Awards was founded in 1962 and is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the Chinese-speaking film industry, with submissions mainly coming from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.Last year, Chinese movie \"Dying to Survive\" won and was nominated in 7 award categories, while Chinese director Zhang Yimou won best director for his period film \"Shadow.\"Taiwan is self-governed and has a democratically elected leadership, but China claims the island as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to ensure unification. The question of Taiwan's formal independence is one of Beijing's most sensitive political concerns.China's content regulator has also been taking an extra-cautious stance over its media industry in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, on Oct. 1, pulling off a few blockbusters and banning \"entertainment-driven\" historical dramas and idol dramas.Reports of the suspension soon became a trending topic on China's Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service, with one related hashtag receiving more than 68 million views Wednesday morning.\"Taiwan made this award political first, don't we have a right to punch back?\" said a Weibo commentator.Others expressed disappointment at the decision.\"Politics aside, this is a lose-lose situation. There isn't an impartial and matchable award in mainland China, what a pity!\" said another commentator.", "China warns Hong Kong protesters not to \u00e2\u0080\u0098play with

the \"violent criminals\" pushing the city toward a \"dangerous abyss\" would be brought to justice.Hong Kong has suffered weeks of sometimes violent protests that began with opposition to a now-suspended extradition law, which would have allowed suspects to be tried in mainland courts.But the protests have swelled into a broader backlash against the government of the Asian financial hub and its political masters in Beijing.\"I would like to warn all of the criminals: don't ever misjudge the situation and mistake our restraint for weakness,\" the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said in a document issued during a briefing in Beijing.A small group of violent radicals were at the forefront of the protests, with \"some kind-hearted citizens who have been misguided and coerced to join,\" according to the document attributed to two officials, Yang Guang and Xu Luying.It said anti-China forces were the \"behind-the-scenes masterminds\" who had \"openly and brazenly emboldened\" the protesters.\"We would like to make clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: those who play with fire will perish by it,\" the office said.\"At the end of the day, they will eventually be punished.\"China has been quick to label U.S. officials as \"black hands\" instigating unrest in Hong Kong in an attempt to contain China's development, but it has not provided any concrete evidence.A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Friday urged the Trump Administration to suspend future sales of munitions and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong police, which have been accused of using excessive force.Police on Monday fired tear gas at protesters in the former British colony after a general strike hit transport and the city's Beijing-backed leader, chief executive Carrie Lam, warned its prosperity was at risk.The protests surpassed earlier shows of dissent in scale and intensity, seemingly stoked Lam's refusal once again to meet any of the protesters' demands, including for her resignation and independent inquiries into police use of force.The protests are the greatest political threat to Hong Kong's government since the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong has remained in barracks since protests started in April, leaving Hong Kong's police force to deal with the massive demonstrations.Last week, the PLA garrison there issued a video showing \"anti-riot\" exercises, and its top brass warned violence is \"absolutely impermissible.\"Diplomats and foreign security analysts are watching the situation closely, but believe there's little appetite in Beijing for the PLA to be deployed on the streets of Hong Kong.So far, the central government and the PLA have said only that there are clear provisions in law covering the prospect of the force's intervention in the city.During the briefing, Yang called the PLA \"a strong force that defends every inch of its sacred territory,\" and said the central government would not allow any \"turbulence\" beyond the control of the Hong Kong government to threaten national unity or security.\"The PLA is a force of power but also a civilized power,\" Yang said.\"As long as it has the strong support of the central government and the Chinese people, the Hong Kong government and police \"are fully capable of punishing those criminal activities and restoring public order and stability,\" he said.", "China: U.S. currency manipulator labeling could cause market chaos,REUTERS,August,6,2019": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI--China's central bank said on Tuesday that Washington's decision to label Beijing as a currency manipulator would \"severely damage international financial order and cause chaos in financial markets.\"Washington's decision to ratchet up currency tensions on Monday would also \"prevent a global economic and trade recovery,\" the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in the country's first official response to the latest U.S. salvo in the two sides' rapidly escalating trade war.China \"has not used and will not use the exchange rate as a tool to deal with trade disputes,\" the PBOC said in a statement on its website.\"China advised the United States to rein in its horse before the precipice, and be aware of its errors, and turn back from the wrong path,\" it said.The U.S. currency accusation, which followed a sharp slide in the yuan on Monday, has driven an even bigger wedge between the world's largest economies and crushed any lingering hopes for a quick resolution to their year-long trade war.The dispute has already spread beyond tariffs to other areas such as technology, and analysts caution tit-for-tat measures could widen in scope and severity, weighing further on business confidence and global economic growth.The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday it had determined for the first time since 1994 that China was manipulating its currency, taking their trade dispute beyond tariffs.The U.S. decision was driven purely by political motive to \"vent its anger\", said Global Times, an influential Chinese tabloid published by the Ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.China \"no longer expects goodwill from the United States,\" Hu Xijin, the newspaper's editor-in-chief, tweeted on Tuesday.The U.S. decision to label China a manipulator came less than three weeks after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the yuan's value was in line with China's economic fundamentals, while the U.S. dollar was overvalued by 6% to 12%.The U.S law sets out three criteria for identifying manipulation among major trading partners: a material global current account surplus, a significant trade surplus with the United States, and persistent one-way intervention in foreign exchange markets.Chinese state media had warned that Beijing could use its dominant position as a rare earths exporter to the United States as leverage in the trade dispute. The materials are used in everything from military equipment to high-tech consumer electronics.Shares in some of China's rare earth-related firms surged on Tuesday amid speculation the sector could be the next front in the trade war.Beijing could also step up pressure on U.S. companies operating in China, analysts say.Beijing in June issued a travel advisory warning Chinese tourists about the risks of travelling to the United States, citing concerns about gun violence, robberies and thefts.Air China said on Tuesday that it was suspending its flights on the Beijing-Honolulu route starting on Aug. 27, following a review of its network.In a further sign of deteriorating ties, China's commerce ministry announced overnight that its companies had stopped buying U.S. agricultural products in retaliation against Washington's latest tariff threat.\"In the end, the United States will eat the fruit of its own labor,\" the PBOC said.Chinese monetary authorities let the yuan fall past the closely watched 7 level on Monday so that markets could finally factor in concerns around the trade war and weakening economic growth, three people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters on Monday.The yuan has tumbled as much as 2.7% against the dollar over the past three days to 11-year lows after President Donald Trump's sudden declaration last week that he will impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1.But it appeared to steady on Tuesday amid signs that China's central bank may be looking to stem the slide, which has sparked fears of a global currency war.The offshore yuan fell to a record low of 7.1397 per dollar on Tuesday before clawing back losses after the central bank said it was selling yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong, a move seen as curtailing short selling of the currency.Onshore yuan also opened weaker before steadying, but remained below the 7 level. While the central bank set a slightly firmer-than-expected morning benchmark rate, it was still the weakest since May 2008.The PBOC has insisted the value of its yuan is determined by the market, though it has maintained a firm grip on the currency and supported it when it neared sensitive levels over the past year.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. government will engage with the IMF to eliminate unfair competition from Beijing.An IMF spokeswoman said the organization does not have any immediate comment.After determining a country is a manipulator, the Treasury is required to demand special talks aimed at correcting an undervalued currency, with penalties such as exclusion from U.S. government procurement contracts.\"Naming China a currency manipulator could open the door for U.S. tariffs to eventually increase to more than 25% on Chinese goods,\" according to a note from DBS Group Research.", "U.N. urges sanctions on Myanmar army businesses,REUTERS,August,6,2019": "JAKARTA--United Nations investigators urged world leaders on Monday to impose targeted financial sanctions on companies linked to the military in Myanmar, and said foreign firms doing business with them could be complicit in international crimes.A panel of human rights experts identified scores of companies tied to the army, which controls vast swathes of Myanmar's economy through holding firms and their subsidiaries, and is accused by the U.N. of executing a campaign with \"genocidal intent\" against the Rohingya minority.More than 730,000 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, fled Myanmar's Rakhine state into neighboring Bangladesh amid a military-led crackdown in August 2017 that the U.N. and Western countries have said included mass killings and gang-rapes.The U.N. investigatory panel condemned the violence in a report last year that called for the economic isolation of the military. Investigators said the purpose of the new report was to help countries cut financial ties with all army-linked companies.\"For the first time, this report comes out with a clear picture of the involvement of specific European and Asian companies, and makes a point that in fact there is this relationship and it's a violation of U.N. treaties and U.N. norms,\" panel chairman Marzuki Darusman said in an interview in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Sunday.A military spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment. Zaw Htay, a spokesman for civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi's government, could not immediately be reached for comment. The Myanmar government was sent an advance copy of the U.N. report.The investigators identified at least 59 foreign companies with some form of commercial ties to the Myanmar military, including firms from France, Belgium, Switzerland, Hong Kong and China. Of those, 15 operate joint ventures with the two military conglomerates or their subsidiaries, the report said.Calling for the imposition of an arms embargo on the country, the investigators also named 14 companies that have sold weapons and related equipment to security forces in the country since 2016, including state-owned entities in Israel, India, North Korea, and China.Any foreign business activity involving the army and its conglomerates \"posts a high risk of contributing to, or being linked to, violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law,\" the report said.\"Corporations and individuals responsible within that corporation can be prosecuted,\" Darusman said, adding that the arms they provide allow the military to \"continue their oppression to the Myanmar people.\" A U.N spokesman later said that Darusman meant to refer to individuals, not corporations.Myanmar has previously rejected the U.N.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s categorization of the violence in Rakhine as \"one-sided.\" It says that military action that followed militant attacks on security forces in August 2017 was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation.The United States, the European Union, Australia, and Canada have imposed sanctions on senior military officers including most recently Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, hit with a travel ban by the State Department in July.The U.N. has said top generals should be prosecuted for genocide and the International Criminal Court has begun a preliminary probe.The EU has also been considering stripping the country of tariff-free access to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest trading bloc.The military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two major conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corp (MEC) are sprawling holding companies with investments spanning various sectors including gems, copper, telecoms and clothing. They own two of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest banks, Myawaddy and Innwa.The two conglomerates have numerous subsidiaries--the report identified 120 businesses in various sectors, from tourism and banking to construction and gem mining, as owned by MEHL and MEC, as well as another 27 linked to the two companies through corporate structures.The revenue generated by such businesses strengthens the army's autonomy from civilian oversight and provides financial support for their operations, investigators said.They urged investigations into 45 companies that made donations to Myanmar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military at three funding ceremonies held by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing at the height of the violence in Rakhine in 2017.During these ceremonies he called for funds to support the military in Rakhine and to build a barrier fence on the border with Bangladesh, the U.N said, adding that more than $10 million was donated.Two local companies, KBZ Group and Max Myanmar, donated $2.5 million and more than $900,000 to Min Aung Hlaing respectively, the report said, in part to fund the border fence \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowing that it would contribute to the suffering and anguish associated with preventing the displaced Rohingya population from returning to their homes and land.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA spokesman for KBZ Group said the company had not been contacted by the U.N during its investigation and was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot yet in a position to comment further.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max Myanmar Group said in a statement it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccategorically denies\u00e2\u0080\u009d the allegations, saying the funds were \u00e2\u0080\u009csolely and particularly intended for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "U.S. designates China as currency manipulator,REUTERS,August,6,2019": "WASHINGTON--The U.S. government has determined that China is manipulating its currency and will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate unfair competition from Beijing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Monday.The move brings already tense U.S.-Chinese relations to a boil and fulfills U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to label China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.The U.S. action follows China allowing its yuan to weaken past the key 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade. Beijing later said it would stop buying U.S. agricultural products, inflaming a yearlong trade war with the United States.The sharp 1.4% drop in the yuan comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump stunned financial markets by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, abruptly breaking a brief ceasefire in a bruising trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and slowed growth.The news knocked the dollar sharply lower and bolstered the price of gold.The Treasury Department said a statement from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday made clear that Chinese authorities had ample control over the yuan exchange rate.The PBOC said Monday it would \"continue to ... take necessary and targeted measures against the positive feedback behavior that may occur in the foreign exchange market.\"\"This is an open acknowledgement by the PBOC that it has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis,\" the Treasury statement said.It said China's actions violate its commitment to refrain from competitive devaluation as part of the Group of 20 industrialized countries. Treasury said it expected China to adhere to those commitments and not target China's exchange rate for competitive purposes.U.S. law sets out three criteria for identifying manipulation among major trading partners: a material global current account surplus, a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and persistent one-way intervention in foreign exchange markets.After determining a country is a manipulator, the Treasury is required to demand special talks aimed at correcting an undervalued currency, with penalties such as exclusion from U.S. government procurement contracts.The U.S. Treasury had designated Taiwan and South Korea as currency manipulators in 1988, the year that Congress enacted the currency review law. China was the last country to get the designation, in 1994.In May, the Treasury had refrained from declaring China a currency manipulator based on new tougher criteria measuring a country's global current account surplus, along with persistent one-way intervention and a large bilateral trade surplus with the United States.In the report, however, Treasury kept China on an enhanced monitoring list due to a \"misalignment and undervaluation of the RMB relative to the dollar.\"", "Extradition protests in Hong Kong morphed into bigger challenge,REUTERS,August,6,2019": "HONG KONG--Police fired tear gas at protesters in multiple parts of Hong Kong on Monday after a general strike hit transport and the city's Beijing-backed leader warned its prosperity was at risk.The protests surpassed earlier shows of dissent in scale and intensity, seemingly stoked by Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam's refusal once again to meet any of the protesters' demands, while warning of an \"extremely dangerous situation.\"What started several months ago as demonstrations over an extradition bill that would have let people be sent to mainland China for trial have grown into a much broader backlash against the city government and its political masters in Beijing.The protests are the greatest political threat to the former British colony's government since it returned to Chinese rule and one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Amid extensive disruptions to trains and traffic, tens of thousands of demonstrators fanned out across Hong Kong, spreading pockets of activism to most of its main three regions: Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories.Police stations were besieged and roads occupied.In the evening, a group of men armed with sticks tried to attack the black-clad protesters in the North Point district.Riot police used tear gas in districts including Wong Tai Sin, Tin Shui Wai, Tai Po, and Admiralty close to the city's government headquarters.Speaking to the media for the first time in two weeks, Lam remained defiant, rejecting calls to resign, condemning violence and saying the government would be resolute.She warned that the protests were putting Hong Kong on a path of no return and had hurt its economy.\"They claim they want a revolution and to restore Hong Kong. These actions have far exceeded their original political demands,\" said a stern-faced Lam, flanked by some, but not all senior members of her administration.\"These illegal acts that challenge our country's sovereignty, and jeopardize 'one country two systems,' will destroy the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,\" Lam said, referring to the territory's administrative system since 1997, when it was handed back to China.Demonstrators fear China is gradually encroaching on the island's cherished autonomy.China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said it would hold another news conference on Tuesday at 2.30 p.m., after one last Monday that announced no new major policy shifts by Beijing despite the upheavals.\"I don't think the government is doing anything to heal society... They provide no solution,\" said Jay Leung, 20, a university student who joined a protest, dismissing Lam's words as a waste of time.\"I didn't hear anything positive, she just made it worse,\" added tourism worker Russell, 38.Demonstrators blocked key roads, including three tunnels, cutting major arteries linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon Peninsula. In Yuen Long district, a car rammed through a barricade, knocking down protesters.Commuters struggled to get to work, with many rail and bus services suspended by activists who blocked trains from leaving stations, some by sitting in doorways.Long lines of traffic snaked across Hong Kong island into the heart of the business center and hundreds of people were stranded at the airport, where more than 200 flights were cancelled at one point.Many businesses shut, and workers stayed home.\"Losing a bit of money now is not such a problem, (compared) with losing everything that the freedom of Hong Kong used to stand for,\" said Mark Schmidt, 49, a restaurant manager who closed on Monday.In an upmarket shopping mall in Sha Tin, scores of shops were shuttered, including clothing retailer H&M as well as luxury brands Chanel and Dior. Protesters in the shopping center chanted: \"Strike! Support to the end.\"Many stores in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay were closed for part of the day as well as businesses close to the protests.Members of the Hong Kong Disneyland Cast Members Union went on strike, as did many lifeguards, forcing authorities to close some beaches and swimming pools.Police, who some have accused of using excessive force, said the situation was spiraling out of control.Authorities said 420 people have been arrested over the protests since June 9, while police have fired 1,000 rounds of tear gas and about 160 rubber bullets.The protesters' demands include a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent inquiry into government handling of the crisis.With tourist numbers falling and hotel occupancy rates slumping, the protests are piling pressure on a struggling economy.IHS Markit's July Purchasing Managers' Index for Hong Kong showed private sector business activity dropped to its lowest level in a decade, also weighed down by the Sino-U.S. trade war.\"I would not be surprised if we see a technical recession--two consecutive quarters of contraction,\" said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at ANZ.The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed down 2.9 percent, falling to its lowest level since January.", "A day of striking sows chaos across Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,6,2019": "HONG KONG--A general strike in Hong Kong descended into citywide mayhem Monday as defiant protesters started fires outside police stations and hurled bricks and eggs at officers. After disrupting traffic early in the day, they filled public parks and squares in several districts, refusing to disperse even as police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets from above.While previous large rallies over the past two months of anti-government protests have generally been held on weekends, Monday's strike paralyzed city operations in an effort to draw more attention to the movement's demands.Hong Kong is on \"the verge of a very dangerous situation,\" said Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who insisted that she has no plans to resign.Lam said at a news conference that the protests had \"ulterior motives\" that threaten Hong Kong's prosperity and security. \"I don't think at this point in time, resignation of myself or some of my colleagues would provide a better solution,\" she said.Protesters challenged law enforcement in at least eight districts, responding to continuous rounds of tear gas with practiced swiftness. They lobbed the canisters back at police and yelled invectives. When police arrived, the protesters clacked their umbrellas together and pounded on metal street signs, daring the officers to move closer.\"Gangsters!\" they jeered at the riot police. \"Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time.\"In one neighborhood after nightfall, a band of men wielding wooden poles charged protesters from behind a thin road lane divider. The demonstrators fought back by throwing traffic cones, metal barricades and rods. Hong Kong media also reported a brawl in a different district where men with knives slashed at protesters.In another neighborhood, demonstrators besieged police headquarters in what they called a \"flash mob.\" They threw bricks and flaming bottles at the building before rapidly retreating.The violence followed a day of striking that sparked bedlam throughout the city. Protesters started early, with the aim of hampering the morning rush hour. In the subway, they blocked train and platform doors, activated emergency alarms and threw objects onto the tracks.A high number of strikers in the airline industry also led to more than 77 flight cancellations, according to the airport authority.\"Too much,\" said 52-year-old John Chan, whose flight to Singapore was cancelled. \"Why do they have to create trouble for people not involved in their cause? Hong Kong is sinking. The government, police and protest people have to stop fighting and give us a break.\"The strike was the latest action in a summer of fiery demonstrations that began in response to proposed extradition legislation that would have allowed some suspects to be sent to mainland China for trials.While the government has since suspended the bill, protesters have pressed on with broader calls for it to be scrapped entirely, along with demands for democratic reforms including the dissolution of the current legislature and an investigation into alleged police brutality. In recent weeks, footage has shown police officers beating protesters and ignoring calls for help during a mob attack that left 44 injured in a commuter rail station.Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997 under a framework of \"one country, two systems,\" which promised the city certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland. With the arrests of booksellers and activists in recent years, however, some Hong Kong residents feel that Beijing has been eroding their rights.The Communist Party-led central government in Beijing has condemned what it calls violent and radical protesters who have vandalized the Chinese national emblem and more recently thrown the country's flag into the iconic Victoria Harbour. China has accused unnamed \"foreign forces\" of inflaming the demonstrations out of a desire to contain the country's development.CCTV, China's state broadcaster, warned Monday that the \"maniacs and thugs\" will \"pay a price.\"\"Please become aware of your errors, turn back from your incorrect path and set down the butcher's knives,\" said an editorial read aloud on the noon news program.A slick publicity video released last week by the Chinese army garrison regularly stationed in Hong Kong fed speculation that Beijing will deploy the military to quell the mass demonstrations. But Kong Wing-cheung, a police spokesman, said the city's officers are fully supported by the government and there will be no need to deploy the military.More than 400 protesters have been arrested since June 9, when a massive march drew more than 1 million people and launched the protest movement. Those being held, who range in age from 14 to 76, face charges including rioting, unlawful assembly, possessing offensive weapons and assaulting officers and obstructing police operations, said spokeswoman Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan.Yu said police have used 1,000 tear gas grenades and fired more than 300 non-lethal bullets. More than 100 officers have been injured. Yu added that violence has been escalating, with protesters using gasoline bombs and fire.\"If we continue to tolerate and turn a blind eye to lawless behavior, the consequences will be undesirable for our citizens,\" she said.As demonstrators were marching through a business district Monday afternoon, some separated from the line and stopped to heckle a police officer in a watchtower. One person in a balaclava started throwing bricks at the lookout.A man on his way home from work peered at the scene with a look of anguish.The 40-year-old I.T. worker named Edward Chan said he couldn't go on strike because he feared judgment from his superiors. He added he's tormented by thoughts of the kind of Hong Kong his 12-year-old daughter will inherit.Tears welled as he watched the ragtag young protesters stream past in their gas masks and helmets. \"If we put them all in jail, how will their parents feel?\" he asked. \"Where will our future go?\"", "Hong Kong police fire tear gas as strikes paralyze city,REUTERS,August,5,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police fired tear gas at protesters on Monday as a general strike plunged the Asian financial hub into fresh chaos, paralyzing transport and bringing the city to an unprecedented standstill for much of the morning.As some train and bus services resumed, tens of thousands of demonstrators fanned out across several districts, where protests again degenerated into running clashes with riot police.Speaking to the media for the first time in two weeks, Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam warned again that the protests were pushing the city to the edge of an \"extremely dangerous situation\" and represented a challenge to China's sovereignty.Lam remained defiant as she rejected calls from protesters demanding her resignation, saying the government would be resolute in maintaining law and order.She warned that the protests were putting the former British colony on a path of no return and had hurt its economy.\"They claim they want a revolution and to restore Hong Kong.

On Sunday, thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully in the town of Tseung Kwan O in the New Territories brandishing colorful banners and leaflets.Dressed in black the protesters cheered as they called for a mass strike across Hong Kong on Monday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to tell the government to (withdraw) the extradition bill and to police to stop the investigations and the violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gabriel Lee, a 21-year-old technology student.Lee said what made him most angry was that the government was not responding to any of the protesters' demands or examining the police violence.Protesters on Saturday set fires in the streets, outside a police station and in rubbish bins, and blocked the entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, cutting a major artery linking Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula.Major shops in the popular tourist and commercial area Nathan Road, normally packed on a Saturday, were shuttered including 7-11 convenience stores, jewelry chain Chow Tai Fook and watch brands Rolex and Tudor.What started as an angry response to the now suspended extradition bill, has expanded to demands for greater democracy and the resignation of leader Carrie Lam.The protests have become the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago after being governed by Britain.Thousands of civil servants joined in the anti-government protests on Friday for the first time since they started in June, defying a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral.The protests mark the biggest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012.China's official news agency Xinhua wrote on Sunday that the \"central government will not sit idly by and let this situation continue. We firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges ahead. \"Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.Months of demonstrations are taking a growing toll on the city's economy, as local shoppers and tourists avoid parts of one of the world's most famous shopping destinations.Matthew Wang, a 22-year-old marketing executive for a multinational corporation, said that the government was \"encouraging people to become more radical to affect decision making because they are not addressing any of the demands.\"", "Hong Kong protesters and police face off in familiar cycle,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,August,4,2019": "HONG KONG--On one end of a Hong Kong street, protesters dressed in black ducked behind umbrellas and makeshift barricades, occasionally throwing bricks or slinging rocks. On the other end, police decked out in riot gear shouted warnings and fired tear gas.As the late hours of Saturday stretched into the early hours of Sunday, neither side budged. Some residents of neighborhoods embroiled in the scuffles banded together with protesters in an effort to push riot police out and surrounded a police station.Standoffs between demonstrators and authorities have become a weekly occurrence in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory that has been roiled by a summer of fiery protest. What began as demonstrations against a now-suspended extradition bill has ballooned into a broader call for greater democratic freedoms and government accountability.The now-familiar cycle of rallies, police interventions and clashes between the two sides have splintered the city. While tens of thousands marched Saturday through Mong Kok, a bustling shopping area, to call for an inquiry into alleged police brutality, another several thousand in a different part of the city gathered to show support for law enforcement.At one rally, attendees chanted: \"Support the Hong Kong police to strictly enforce the law!\" At another, protesters yelled: \"Police know the law and break the law!\"Several pro-democracy rally participants expressed disappointment in what they viewed as abusive and negligent behavior from police in recent weeks. After thugs dressed in white beat up people inside a commuter rail station, leaving 44 injured, Hong Kong residents accused the police of deliberately being slow to respond. Police, meanwhile, said their resources were stretched because of the ongoing protests.\"I feel so hurt,\" said Zarine Chau, a 56-year-old security guard who was at the pro-democracy march. She said she rarely got involved in politics in the past, but felt moved to do so after seeing videos of police swinging their batons at protesters.\"Why doesn't the government answer to us?\" Chau asked.Members of the movement have demanded the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. As with all the city's chief executives, Lam was not elected by the general population but rather chosen by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.When Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city was promised certain freedoms under the framework of \"one country, two systems,\" creating a distance between the territory and the Communist Party-ruled central government on the mainland. In recent years, however, some Hong Kong residents have accused Beijing of chipping away at their democratic rights as booksellers and activists have been arrested. The proposed extradition legislation would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the mainland to stand trial.An undercurrent of fear toward the Communist Party has propelled the nearly two months of protests. After protesters defied police orders to end their Saturday march at a pre-approved time and place, some scaled a flagpole near the iconic Victoria Harbour, removed from it the Chinese national flag, and flung the flag into the water.Shortly afterward, a 38-year-old protester named Paladin Cheng planted himself beside the poles with his own set of flags, which read \"Hong Kong Independence.\"\"We're losing our freedom little by little,\" said Cheng, who was clad in head-to-toe black with a black visor and face mask. \"Those who don't support Hong Kong independence will have no choice but to become Chinese.\"A similar act a few weeks ago infuriated authorities in Beijing when demonstrators threw eggs and black paint at the national emblem on the Liaison Office, which represents the mainland government in Hong Kong. China called the vandalism a \"violent\" act that challenged its authority.Ryan Chan, a chemist, said he sympathized with the protesters' ideals but was dismayed that peaceful demonstrations were increasingly devolving into violence and creating chaos in the city.\"I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people in Hong Kong do not like violence,\" he said. \"The atmosphere here is becoming more and more uncomfortable.\"Police warned in a press briefing earlier Saturday that those who continued beyond the permitted route would be participating in an illegal, unauthorized assembly. Last week, 44 protesters were charged with rioting, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.After scores of officers in riot gear appeared to clear the streets Saturday, some protesters set fire to trash bins and pieces of cardboard, and used sling shots to hurl rocks. Others threw bricks at and spray painted inflammatory language on the outer walls of a police station, then smashed the windows of a car parked in its lot.Clad in their signature hard hats, black shirts and face masks, they once again created barricades with reappropriated road barriers. \"One two, one two,\" the protesters chanted as they fell back in step, only to suddenly charge at police minutes later. Police in turn threw canister after canister of tear gas, enveloping the streets with smoke.As the standoffs dragged on, police also blocked local residents and tourists from returning to their homes and hotels. A mainland Chinese tourist surnamed Wang said he thought the protesters were naive.\"It's impossible for one country, two systems to last,\" said Wang, a retired police officer. \"Sooner or later, they will rejoin China, and our government will deal with them.\"At least for the time being, the protesters seem to be gearing up for a drawn-out struggle. Even as they were retreating from tear gas, they were looking ahead to another planned demonstration, shouting: \"Strike on Monday!\"", "Protesters march in Hong Kong as rival rally supports police,REUTERS,August,3,2019": "HONG KONG-- Thousands of mostly black-clad activists set off on a protest march in Hong Kong's Mong Kok district on Saturday, as the Chinese-controlled city braced for another weekend of anti-government demonstrations.Protests against a proposed bill allowing people to be extradited to stand trial in mainland China have escalated since June, growing increasingly violent, with police accused of excessive force and failing to protect protesters from suspected gang attacks.Mong Kok, which includes gritty working class sections and is also a popular shopping destination, was the scene of some of the most violent clashes during pro-democracy protests in 2014.Many of Saturday's demonstraters wore yellow or white hard hats, and the crowds chanted \"age of revolution!\" and \"Hongkongers, add oil!\" - a popular exhortation in Cantonese.\"I'm a little worried about whether the police force might use violent ways on the demonstrators because the route of the demonstration is a little bit narrow, and if we want to leave it might be difficult to get away from the police,\" said a 20-year-old university student named Ivan.\"I think this entire movement will continue until at least the end of 2019,\" he said.Hundreds of marchers held posters with an illustration of protesters in hard hats tending to a young child, with the words \"protect the future\".The crowd was mostly young, but also included families and many older people. Some young couples held hands.\"We are here because we want to stick up for Hong Kong. We don't need an evil law to take over Hong Kong,\" said a woman surnamed Yau who was joined by family members including her 11-year-old daughter.As the marchers gathered at the starting point, one passed around pre-paid subway cards to young groups, while others gave out chicken wings and McDonalds food. When the march started, volunteers handed out hard hats, face masks and water bottles.Most of the shops in the upscale Langham Place shopping mall had pulled down their shutters by late afternoon, and many street-facing businesses along the march route had closed.Across the harbour, on Hong Kong island, thousands of police supporters, mostly wearing white, gathered for a separate rally amid a carnival-like atmosphere in Victoria Park.Many waved Hong Kong and Chinese flags and the crowd shouted slogans in support of the police. Pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho was greeted with strong applause.\"We are the real Hong Kong people who are not the same as those black-shirted thugs. We don't need a so-called 'HK revolution', we only need to do our best, which is enough,\" he told the crowd.Sylvia Lam, 61, who described herself as a housewife, said she had turned up at the pro-police rally to oppose violence.\"I feel extremely uncomfortable when every time I watch TV, the scenes are so radical,\" she said.\"Young people should stop and think, don't become someone's political tools, be rational please,\" she said.Further anti-government protests were scheduled for Sunday, with activists calling for a mass strike on Monday.On Friday evening in central Hong Kong, thousands of civil servants defied a warning from authorities to remain politically neutral and joined anti-government protests for the first time since they started two months ago.In Washington on Friday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers called on the Trump administration to halt future sales of munitions and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong's police force, which has been accused of using excessive force against protesters.Under Chinese rule, Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary, but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.The protests are the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to China 22 years ago.They also pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took office in 2012 and come as Xi grapples with an escalating trade war with the United States and a slowing economy in a politically sensitive year.

As rain hit the umbrella-ready crowd, attendees dispersed willingly, avoiding the police clashes that have increasingly beleaguered demonstrations.\"As civil servants, if we don't stand up, that means we are disloyal,\" said K. H. Wu, a retiree who worked for the government's Census Department for 40 years. \"Our loyalties are not to a particular government, but to the people.\"Wu attended the rally with his wife, also a civil servant. He said this was the first time he participated in a rally in which he openly shared his status as a former government worker. He said he did so because he feels \"there's nothing to be afraid of.\"\"Right now the Hong Kong government is blindly leading the people,\" Wu said. \"They disregard the needs of the population. With Hong Kong like this right now, you have to rid yourself of all fear.\"Officials had warned civil servants ahead of the rally they could be disciplined if they showed partiality or criticized special officials and polices. The increased risk was written into posters about the event, which cautioned participants against calling for the resignation of government officials, expressing anything related to Hong Kong independence and accepting donations.As the crowd flooded into the streets, demonstrators held up signs saying \"We are civil servants and willing to step up!\" and \"Political neutrality does not equal conscienceless.\"About a thousand medical workers participated in a rally Friday in another part of the city.

At the end of the drill, soldiers are seen taking some handcuffed civilians away.This week, Hong Kong police arrested 44 people on rioting charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.In the latest action, hundreds of finance workers participated in Hong Kong flash mob Thursday night, demanding the government answer Hong Kong citizens' demands over a controversial extradition bill that sparked the demonstrations and expressing anger over accusations of collusion last month between police and organized crime groups who attacked protesters.Participants carried umbrellas and flashed lights with their cellphones, while chanting \"Hong Kong keep going\" and calling for support for a city-wide strike planned for Monday.\"I think young people should have more opportunity to speak up and the government should have listened to them because young people are the future pillars of our society,\" said Peggie Wong, 42, who works in public finance.Past and present pro-Beijing politicians have alleged that the United States and Taiwan have been guiding the protests, a claim denied by officials including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 on the principle of \"one country, two systems.\" The framework promises Hong Kong certain democratic freedoms not afforded to the mainland.

It came as U.S. and Chinese negotiators resumed talks to end trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.Neither Zhongwang or Liu, who is still the company's controlling shareholder, have received any notice of the proceedings, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday.Zhongwang has previously described smuggling allegations as \"misleading\" and \"without any factual basis.\"\"The company would like to clarify that the group has always strictly abided by in its business operation the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China and destination countries of its exported products, and has developed overseas markets under the principle of fair and orderly competition,\" it said in the statement to the exchange.Zhongwang's shares fell as much as 20.9 percent on Thursday to HK$3.17 ($0.41 or 45 yen), the lowest since January 2016.Liu is believed to be in China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and an arrest warrant has been drawn up, according to The Wall Street Journal. It was unclear whether Liu has a U.S.-based lawyer. Liu and his family are worth $3.2 billion, Forbes magazine said.Prosecutors said the alleged scheme began as early as 2008, and eventually involved efforts to escape duties imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2011 on various types of extruded aluminum imported from China.The indictment said companies affiliated with Liu went through ports in the Los Angeles area to import aluminum extrusions that were \"tack-welded\" together, to appear as finished \"pallets\" that were not subject to duties.Prosecutors said Liu would then stockpile the aluminum at four southern California warehouses, and with his associates orchestrate bogus sales to companies he controlled to inflate Zhongwang's financials and make it appear more valuable.Liu, also known as \"Big Boss\" and \"Uncle Liu\" according to the indictment, was also accused by prosecutors of running a \"massive\" money laundering operation involving the use of shell companies to transfer funds to Zhongwang.U.S. authorities said the scheme gave Liu's companies an unfair advantage over American rivals and posed other hazards.\"Our national security is jeopardized when domestic industry loses its ability to develop and supply products for U.S. defense and critical infrastructure applications, forcing us to become dependent on unreliable imports,\" Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for homeland security investigations in Los Angeles, said in a statement.Liu and several other defendants face charges of wire fraud, money laundering, passing fraudulent papers through a customhouse and conspiracy.Most counts carry a maximum 20-year prison term, and if served consecutively carry a maximum 465-year term.The case is U.S. v Liu et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 19-cr-00282.", "U.S., China end round of trade talks; no word on progress,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,31,2019": "SHANGHAI--U.S. and Chinese envoys met Wednesday for talks aimed at ending a tariff war after U.S. President Donald Trump rattled financial markets by accusing Beijing of trying to stall in hopes he will fail to win re-election in 2020.The meeting ended about 40 minutes ahead of schedule. Neither delegation spoke to reporters before U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin left for the airport.Economists had said quick breakthroughs were unlikely because the two governments face the same disagreements over China's technology policy and trade surplus that caused talks to break down in May. Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume negotiations but neither has given any sign of offering big concessions.The dispute over U.S. complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology has battered exporters on both sides and disrupted trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment. Trump has raised tariffs on $250 billion (27 trillion yen) worth of Chinese imports while Beijing responded by taxing $110 billion of U.S. products.Chinese leaders are resisting U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led development of industry leaders in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technologies. Washington complains those efforts depend on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology.For their part, American negotiators are reluctant to cede to Chinese demands that punitive U.S. tariffs be lifted immediately. Trump wants to keep some penalties in place to ensure Beijing carries out any agreement.Rhetoric on both sides has hardened, prompting suggestions U.S. and Chinese leaders are settling in for a \"war of attrition.\"In Washington, Trump accused Beijing of wanting to stall through the 2020 presidential election in hopes of being able to negotiate with a more malleable Democrat. He said that if re-elected, he would get \"much tougher\" with Beijing.\"China would love to wait and just hope,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday.\"They'll pray that Trump loses,\" he said. \"And then they'll make a deal with a stiff, somebody that doesn't know what they're doing.\"Separately on Twitter, Trump warned that if he wins in 2020, \"the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now ... or no deal at all.\"Asian stock markets tumbled Wednesday after Trump's comments. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.7 percent, Hong Kong's market benchmark dropped 1.3 percent and Tokyo lost 0.9 percent.Trump's \"aggressively tinged\" remarks were a \"stark reminder to investors that the U.S. and China are no closer to an agreement and, in fact, might be drifting farther apart,\" said Stephen Innes of VM Markets in a report.Negotiators in Shanghai are also expected to discuss the fate of telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. Washington put the company, China's first global tech brand, on a security list in May that blocks purchases of U.S. components and technology.The United States says Huawei is a national security threat, an accusation the company denies. Trump has said it could be a bargaining chip in the trade dispute.", "Over 20 charged with rioting appear in Hong Kong court,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Charges were read Wednesday against more than 20 Hong Kong protesters who have been accused of rioting--the most serious charge brought since mass demonstrations began in the city last month.Standing in a heavy rain, supporters rallied outside the court and chanted \"Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our times,\" in what has become a familiar refrain. They are protesting China's influence in the city, a semiautonomous Chinese territory with its own laws and legal system.Police said late Tuesday that 44 people had been charged with rioting and one other with possessing offensive weapons. The accused set up roadblocks, broke fences, damaged street signs and attacked police officers with bricks and iron rods, law enforcement said in a statement.Only 23 appeared in court Wednesday, and all were released on bail. They have to hand over their travel documents and are not allowed to go out in the hours from midnight to 6 a.m. Their sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 25. It was not clear when the others charged will appear in court.They were detained after clashes with police at an unauthorized protest in the western part of Hong Kong island on Sunday, when police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back protesters blocking the streets with road signs and umbrellas. Police issued warnings prior to using the tear gas, but protesters stood their ground and threw eggs at the officers.The large demonstrations started last month as a movement against now-suspended extradition legislation, and have since grown to encompass broader demands around greater democracy and government accountability.The protests have been propelled by an underlying distrust for the ruling Communist Party on the mainland, where speech is tightly controlled and dissenters are routinely jailed.News of the charges prompted quickly organized protests outside two police stations late Tuesday.Several hundred people gathered in the streets outside the Kwai Chung police station. Some threw eggs at the building, while police used pepper spray to try to disperse them. Some had cordoned off an area at a subway station covered in shattered glass where they said an officer had used a firearm.Fireworks were set off just before 3 a.m. at another police station, injuring six men. Video footage on social media appeared to show a car driving by the Tin Shui Wai police station as fireworks flared where protesters were gathered.Five people were taken to a hospital and the sixth man declined medical treatment at the scene, police said. It wasn't clear who was responsible.As the demonstration seeped into the early hours of Wednesday, protesters and supporters remained highly wary of being identified by the authorities and suffering potential retribution at their places of work and study. Volunteers handed out face masks and single-trip subway fare cards that would prevent riders being identified and their trips logged in a central data base, while drivers who had taped paper over their license plates offered rides home.Hong Kong lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki told reporters that the prosecution of protesters and use of police force will only make the situation worse. He blamed Beijing-appointed Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\"The origin of all the violence is Carrie Lam and the very controversial extradition bill,\" he said, adding \"she should come out today to answer to all the requests of most of the people in Hong Kong.\"Kwok also criticized China's repeated statements supporting police efforts to quell the protests, saying Chinese backing would not heal the city.Police have been deploying an increasing range of crowd control measures, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, shotgun beanbag rounds and sponge grenades fired from barrel-mounted grenade launchers.", "Life expectancy hits new highs, with 87.32 years for women,By KYOSUKE YAMAMOTO/ Staff Writer,July,31,2019": "Life expectancy in Japan continued its uptrend in 2018, with women living 87.32 years on average, and men 81.25 years, both record highs.Japanese women and men posted record highs for life expectancy for six and seven years in a row, respectively, according to figures announced July 30 by the health ministry.Longevity among women last year increased by 0.05 year from the previous year, while men gained 0.16 year.\"The result appears to reflect improved medical standards and increased health consciousness,\" said a ministry official, adding that average life expectancy is likely to improve further.The rise is attributed to a decline in death rates for cancer, heart disease and cerebral vascular disease for both sexes. The three diseases accounted for 50.06 percent of deaths for men, and 45.52 percent for women, in 2018.Among the 50 countries and regions covered by the health ministry statistics, the average life expectancy for Japanese women ranked second behind Hong Kong while men ranked third behind No. 1 Hong Kong and Switzerland.Japan's rankings for longevity among men and women were the same as the previous year.", "Pompeo \u00e2\u0080\u0098very hopeful\u00e2\u0080\u0099 U.S.-N. Korea talks will resume soon,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,31,2019": "BANGKOK--U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday he's very hopeful for a quick resumption in nuclear talks with North Korea despite the North's recent weapons tests that have clouded already uncertain prospects for a return to the table.Pompeo told reporters accompanying him to an Asian security conference in Thailand that some preliminary work on a new round of talks has been done but no dates have been set. He said he's waiting to see if North Korea's foreign minister comes to Bangkok for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and is confident they will meet if he does. The State Department says the lead U.S. negotiator, Stephen Biegun, will be in Bangkok for North Korea-related discussions but has not released his schedule.\"We think they'll be started before too long,\" Pompeo said. \"I'm very hopeful.\"Talks have been stalled since U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's summit in February in Hanoi that broke up over disagreements about sanctions relief and what actions the North would have to take in exchange. But they agreed to restart the talks when they met at the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas in June. At the time, U.S. officials spoke of the negotiations resuming in a matter of a few weeks.\"It's taken a little bit longer than that,\" Pompeo said. \"There's been a little bit of preliminary work to be done. I never want to set a date (but) I hope before too long we will have Special Representative Biegun sitting with what I think will be a new counterpart from North Korea.\"Since the latest Trump-Kim meeting, however, and just in the past week, the North has conducted two short-range ballistic missile tests. And, the two sides remain at odds on a definition of denuclearization. The United States says sanctions cannot be removed until the process is complete, although it has said some concessions are possible in return for partial steps.The annual ASEAN security meeting has been used in the past as a venue for U.S.-North Korea talks and although the North has signaled that its top diplomat may not attend this year, Pompeo was nonplussed.\"We don't anticipate that the North Koreans will be at the event in Bangkok, but if they are, I'd look forward to the chance to meet with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho,\" he said, saying such a meeting \"would be great.\" ''We'll see if they are there, and if they are there, I am confident we'll meet.\"Even if such a meeting does not occur, Pompeo will have a full plate of thorny issues to contend with in Bangkok.Among them, rising tensions with China over its increasingly assertive behavior in the South China Sea, hostility toward pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detentions of Muslims and other minorities in the western region of Xinjiang. Pompeo will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday as talks on ending a bitter U.S.-China trade dispute wrap up in Shanghai.Pompeo will also be seeking in Bangkok to ease brewing tensions over trade between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea that threaten to disrupt Seoul's electronics industry and draws on long-standing bitterness over Japan's actions toward Korea during World War II. The dispute also threatens to poison relations at a time when Washington would prefer to see a united front in dealing with North Korea.On Friday, Pompeo will meet the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers separately before convening a three-way meeting among them.\"We will encourage them to find a path forward. We think it's important,\" Pompeo said aboard his plane. \"They're both great partners of ours; they're both working closely with us on our efforts to denuclearize North Korea. So, if we can help them find a good place for each of their two countries, we certainly find that important to the United States, indeed, as well as to each of those two countries. I hope we'll have a good conversation and we can help get to a good place.\"", "\u00e2\u0080\u0098We may lose Christmas\u00e2\u0080\u0099: HK protests taking toll on shops,REUTERS,July,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Months of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong are taking a growing toll on the city's economy, weighing on confidence and scaring away tourists from one of the world's most vibrant shopping destinations.Economists say the impact of anti-government protests over the past eight weeks is already worse than in 2014, when a so-called \"Umbrella revolution\" paralyzed the city's financial district for 79 days.Demonstrations are more spread out across the city this time and violence has been more intense, prompting local and foreign shoppers to avoid certain areas. Stores and even bank branches have been forced to close for prolonged periods.Many businesses in the port city on the southern Chinese coast are already facing strains from China's economic slowdown and fallout from the year-long Sino-U.S. trade war.Various strikes are planned in coming weeks, while disruptive civil disobedience actions are taking place almost daily and look set to continue for months. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters blocked train services, causing commuter chaos.The main retail association has warned members expect a double-digit drop in sales in July and August. The government will release June sales data on Thursday.\"Hong Kong's retail industry will be affected both internally and externally,\" said Angela Cheng, economist at CMB International Capital Corp. Ltd., adding she had revised her 2019 retail sales forecast to as much as a 10 percent drop, twice as deep as her previous estimate.Brokerage CLSA downgraded local jeweler Chow Tai Fook, one of the city's most popular brands with mainland tourists, to \"sell\" from \"outperform\" on July 23, saying the protests could cause permanent long-term damage.Luxury group Richemont warned in July that protests hurt its sales, while Swiss watchmaker Swatch said political turbulence contributed to a double-digit decline in sales in Hong Kong, one of its most important markets globally.Around the Admiralty district, where much of the protests have centered, staff at several restaurants and shops told Reuters on Monday that patrons have dropped by a third from a month earlier.Bobby Tang, a 21-year-old sales representative at a Gucci store in the Causeway Bay shopping district, where protest barricades were raised for the first time on Sunday, supports the civil movement.He says the government has failed to respond to any of its demands, which at first were focused on withdrawing a controversial China extradition bill, but have morphed into a much wider pro-democracy struggle.But he also worries about his job at the French luxury group. Prior to the protests, the store had one client per minute, he said, but now it was three to four per hour and daily sales have fallen to HK$20,000 ($2,560 or 277,474 yen) from HK$100,000.\"If the protests last until October, I worry if I can earn enough salary,\" Tang said.Shopping malls are often being used for rest breaks by protesters wearing helmets and goggles and sometimes carrying makeshift weapons.The protesters have been largely respectful of the premises, but on one occasion one mall turned into a battle ground. As police tried to disperse crowds in the Sha Tin working class district on July 14, it ended up chasing them into a shopping center managed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.Fighting erupted and scenes of regular shoppers with bulky bags running away while trying to maintain balance on bloody, slippery floors were broadcast worldwide.Tourism, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly. Britain, Japan, Singapore and others have issued travel alerts.Hong Kong's Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20 percent in June year-on-year, and probably 40 percent in July.A local tour manager who gave only his surname Yu said around two-thirds of his mainland clients have cancelled bookings.Fitch Ratings said in a note on Tuesday the unrest could damage business confidence and the quality of governance. It also raised longer-term concerns about policy paralysis and erosion of the rule of law.A 1992 U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act allowing Washington to have a different customs regime with Hong Kong than with mainland China was also crucial for the stability of the Chinese-ruled city.For it to stand, U.S. authorities need to see Hong Kong as sufficiently independent from Beijing, therefore they will scrutinize the latter's every step during the protests.Fitch affirmed Hong Kong's AA+ rating on June 11.\"Evidence of a permanent loss of confidence in public institutions or tangible reduction of the territory's semiautonomy as granted under the Basic Law, would ... be grounds to review the ratings,\" Fitch said.The American Chamber of Commerce warned that international businesses were feeling pessimistic on short-term prospects and that the government should take immediate actions to address the root causes of the demonstrations.\"The protests have a chance to last until the end of the year. We may even lose on Christmas, which should be the best sales season,\" said Fung, a sales assistant for a skin care company who only gave her last name.", "Report of riot charges prompts sudden protest in Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters clashed with police again in Hong Kong on Tuesday night after reports that some of their detained colleagues would be charged with the relatively serious charge of rioting.Several hundred protesters mobilized in the streets outside a police station after 44 people were arrested on riot charges stemming from a Sunday night demonstration.Hong Kong police said in a statement Tuesday that the rioters set up roadblocks, broke fences, damaged street signs and attacked police officers with bricks and iron rods.One of the accused is a 33-year-old man who was also charged with assaulting a police officer, police said.The accused rioters and a 24-year-old man charged with weapons possession will appear in court on Wednesday.A total of 49 people, including 32 men and 17 women between the ages of 16 and 41, had initially been arrested from the scene. Hong Kong police said it \"will not rule out the possibility of further arrest\" as it investigates the four others released temporarily or out on bail.Live video streamed by Hong Kong media showed protesters chanting slogans and throwing eggs at the Kwai Chung police station. Police used pepper spray to try to disperse them.The unannounced protest capped another day of unrest. During the morning rush hour, commuters argued with demonstrators who blocked subway train doors in their continuing movement to demand greater accountability from the semiautonomous Chinese territory's government.Service was delayed and partially suspended on the Island and Kwun Tong lines, subway operator MTR said. It cited \"a number of train door obstructions\" as well as someone activating a safety device at a platform on the Kwun Tong line.The action targeted rush hour traffic at several stations. MTR responded by providing minibuses to replace delayed trains, and normal service was restored by around noon.Protester Ken Chan said he wanted MTR officials to explain why they allegedly failed to take action on July 21 when a large gang of men in white shirts brutally beat dozens of people inside a train station as a massive protest was winding down. Hong Kong's government and the central authorities in Beijing have blamed protesters for sparking the confrontation.\"How could they let the triads in white attack people on the platform randomly, including the elderly and children in the train?\" said Chan, 32, using the common term for members of organized crime groups. \"Some of the elderly got smacked on their heads, but (MTR staff) turned a blind eye to it.\"Lorraine Lee, 26, said the subway disruption was an attempt to remind people of the government's alleged failure to deal with social, economic and political injustices.\"The government has not been addressing the problems in our society,\" Lee said. \"That is why now Hong Kongers have no choice but to use different 'creative' approaches to remind people what is happening in Hong Kong.\"Associated Press video showed heated exchanges at Tiu Keng Leng station, where a crowd of protesters and commuters filled the platform and a stopped train.The disruption is part of a pro-democracy movement that has seen hundreds of thousands take to the streets this summer for marches and rallies. The protests have shaken the government in Hong Kong and raised concerns in Beijing. Hong Kong is part of China, but it has a fair degree of autonomy in local affairs.Posts on Twitter showed long lines of commuters waiting for free shuttle buses provided by MTR to other subway stops. Protesters conducted a similar action to block trains last week.Activists began protesting in early June for the government to withdraw an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to stand trial in mainland China, where critics say their legal rights would be threatened. The government suspended the bill, but the protests have expanded to calls for democracy and government accountability.On Sunday, police repeatedly fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back protesters blocking Hong Kong streets with road signs and umbrellas.The protesters have demanded an independent inquiry into police conduct at the demonstrations, which they say has been abusive.China on Monday accused unidentified foreign actors of encouraging the protests. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that the central government \"resolutely opposes any foreign forces' attempts to intervene in Hong Kong affairs.\"\"We have the determination and ability to safeguard peace and stability in Hong Kong,\" Hua said at a daily briefing.On Saturday, Hong Kong police fired tear gas, swung batons and forcefully cleared out protesters who defied warnings not to march.", "Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1st half revenue grows despite U.S. sanctions,REUTERS,July,30,2019": "HONG KONG/SHANGHAI--China's Huawei Technologies said on Tuesday revenue in the first half of the year grew 23.2 percent--faster than a year ago--despite an intense U.S. campaign against it that ultimately became a trade ban from mid-May.Unlisted Huawei, which only started disclosing quarterly results this year, said revenue in the first half rose to 401.3 billion yuan ($58.28 billion or 6.3 trillion yen) from 325.7 billion yuan a year ago, with smartphone shipments reaching 118 million units, up 24 percent.Huawei's supply chain was significantly disrupted when it was put on a trade blacklist by Washington in mid-May. The U.S. government alleges it is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy, which Huawei has repeatedly denied.It has since been given a three-month reprieve till Aug. 19, and U.S. President Trump signaled Washington would be relaxing the sanctions on Huawei, though details are unknown.Huawei's 23 percent revenue growth for the first half compared with the 15 percent growth in the same period of last year.\"Revenue grew fast up through May,\" Huawei Chairman Liang Hua told reporters at an earnings briefing.\"Given the foundation we laid in the first half of the year, we continue to see growth even after we were added to the entity list. That's not to say we don't have difficulties ahead. We do, and they may affect the pace of our growth in the short term.\"Huawei's founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei told reporters last month that the impact of the blacklisting was worse than expected. It could cost the company $30 billion in revenue, and that Huawei's revenue this year and in 2020 could stay roughly the same as 2018 at around $100 billion, he said.Analysts say strong domestic smartphone sales and new 5G carrier contracts helped offset the impact from the export ban that threatens to cut Huawei's access to advanced U.S. components and software such as Google Android apps.According to data from Canalys, Huawei expanded its lead in China's smartphone market in the second quarter, while overseas smartphones sales had a slight drop year-on-year.", "HK protesters disrupt train services, cause commuter chaos,REUTERS,July,30,2019": "HONG KONG--Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters blocked train services during the early morning rush hour on Tuesday, causing commuter chaos in the latest anti-government campaign to roil the former British colony.What started three months ago as rallies against an extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial, has now morphed into a wider backlash against the city's government and its political masters in Beijing.Protests have occurred almost daily, sometimes with little notice, disrupting business, piling pressure on Hong Kong's beleaguered government and stretching the city's police force, which some have accused of using excessive force.Activists blocked train doors, playing havoc with services and forcing hundreds of people to stream out of railway stations in search of alternative transport.\"We don't know how long we are going to stay here, we don't have a leader, as you can see this is a mass movement now,\" said Sharon, a 21-year-old masked protester who declined to give her full name. \"It's not our intention to inconvenience people, but we have to make the authorities understand why we protest. We will continue with this as long as need.\"Others chanted, \"Liberate Hong Kong,\" and \"Revolution of our Time.\"Rail operator MTR Corp. said some services had been disrupted and urged people to seek other forms of transport.Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997, is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades after two months of increasingly violent protests that have posed one of the gravest populist challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing.China on Monday reiterated its support for Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, and its police and urged Hong Kong people to oppose violence.The latest protest follows a demonstration at the Chinese-ruled city's international airport on Friday and violent protests at the weekend when activists clashed with police who fired rubber bullets, tear gas and sponge grenades--a crowd-control weapon.Minor scuffles broke out between protesters and commuters as some grew frustrated over the train stoppage.\"It's so inconvenient and annoying, really. I am in hurry to work, to make a living. Will you give away your salary to me?\" said a 64-year-old man surnamed Liu.", "Beijing reiterates support for Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lam, police,REUTERS,July,29,2019": "BEIJING/HONG KONG--China reiterated on Monday its support for Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, and its police, and called on Hong Kong people to oppose violence following another weekend of clashes between protesters and police in the city.Hong Kong bore the scars on Monday of its eighth straight weekend of violent protests, with hard hats, umbrellas and water bottles littering some central streets.Millions have taken part in street protests against a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.The protests have at times paralyzed parts of the financial district, shut government offices and disrupted business operations across the city. Officials have also warned about the impact of the unrest on Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy.Beijing has stood by the city's pro-Beijing leader Lam, and the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, which has Cabinet-level authority over the former British colony, reiterated that support at a news conference in Beijing on Monday.\"The central government firmly supports Carrie Lam leading the Hong Kong government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration according to law, firmly supports the Hong Kong police strictly enforcing rule of law,\" Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office, told a news conference.The most important thing was for Hong Kong to handle the unrest according to the law, Yang said, blaming irresponsible figures in the West for stirring up the trouble in a bid to contain China's development.Such efforts would fail, he said.Asked under what conditions the People's Liberation Army could intervene, Yang referred as other officials have done, to Hong Kong's mini-Constitution, known as the Basic Law, which states that the Hong Kong government can ask the PLA garrison in the city to help maintain order.Legal scholars have described that as a high threshold.Yang said Hong Kong's government and society needed to come up with more effective ways to help young people address concerns over housing, employment and other issues, although officials did not announce any specific measures to address the unrest.The past weekend saw more clashes between protesters and police, who again fired rubber bullets and tear gas as the demonstrations grow increasingly violent.Police sought to defend China's main representative office in Hong Kong from protesters on Sunday for the second consecutive weekend, with the building near the heart of the city fortified with barricades.Police said they had arrested at least 49 people over Sunday's protests for offenses including unauthorized assembly and possession of offensive weapons.The protests are the most serious political crisis in Hong Kong since it returned to China 22 years ago.They also pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China.Many fear Beijing is increasingly chipping away at those freedoms.What began as a movement to oppose the extradition law has taken on broader demands. They include the resignation of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam, calls for full democracy and an independent inquiry into what some say has been excessive force used by police against protesters.Lam has refused to accede to any of the demands.The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said on Monday that, according to a recent survey, international businesses were pessimistic about the short-term prospects for the city due to escalating violence and political deadlock.Respondents reported a deepening perception within their companies and among overseas customers that Hong Kong had become less safe and a riskier place in which to conduct business, it said.A series of protests are planned over coming weeks and the outlook is increasingly uncertain.Labor Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung, who has tried to mediate between activists and police, told Reuters Lam needed to heed demands to withdraw the extradition bill and set up an independent commission, among other requests.\"Short of that, we would only be spiraling down towards even more violence, death, a curfew and even PLA interference,\" Cheung said.", "Police fire tear gas, rubber bullets at Hong Kong protesters,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,29,2019": "HONG KONG--Police in Hong Kong fired tear gas and rubber bullets repeatedly Sunday to drive back protesters blocking streets with road signs and umbrellas in another night of pitched battles in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.It was the second night in a row that tear gas was used in escalating pro-democracy protests. The demonstrations began early last month to voice opposition to an extradition bill that has since been suspended, but the movement has grown to encompass a broader push for full democracy.Protesters occupied two areas at opposite ends of central Hong Kong on Sunday following a mid-afternoon rally against police use of tear gas at a demonstration the previous weekend.On the western end of Hong Kong Island, one group blocked areas near the Chinese government's liaison office and began to move forward as night fell. Police issued warnings, and protesters threw eggs at them. Officers fired tear gas to halt the advance.Police then embarked on an hourslong effort to push the protesters eastward and get them to disperse.In repeated standoffs, spontaneous but highly organized protesters set up behind scaffolding that they built across a street. Police lined up behind clear shields about 30 meter down the road. Dozens of journalists in bright yellow vests stood in between the two on the sidelines.The police would advance gradually, firing bursts of tear gas. Protesters in hard hats scurried about, rearranging makeshift barriers of pilfered road signs and other items. By the time the police reached the scaffolding, they had backed off about 6 meters.Another team of officers, more mobile with smaller shields, then swept in to clear the area. Some protesters were detained, Hong Kong media reported.Hong Kong has been wracked by protests for seven weeks. Initially, the protesters were demanding the scrapping of a proposed extradition law that would send suspects to mainland China to face trials. The legislation is seen as a threat to Hong Kong's freedoms that were guaranteed for 50 years when China took back control of the former British colony in 1997.The bill was eventually suspended, but the protesters then called for the resignation of the city's leader and an investigation into whether police have used excessive force in quelling the protests.Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment, rather than by direct elections.Earlier Sunday, protesters rallied at a park in Hong Kong's financial district before marching out in several directions despite not winning police approval for a public procession. It was the second straight day that protesters took to the streets without official permission.A sea of black-shirted protesters, some with bright yellow helmets and masks but many with just backpacks, streamed out of Chater Garden park. Chanting \"Add oil,\" a phrase that roughly means \"Keep up the fight,\" a huge crowd marched east down a wide thoroughfare.They stopped near the Sogo department store and set up barricades to block off the area and defend it against police.Another group headed west toward mainland China's liaison office. Protesters egged the office last weekend and splattered black ink on the national emblem, eliciting an angry reaction from the Chinese government.Some stopped about two blocks short of the office and used orange and white construction barricades to build a wall spanning a major road. They massed behind the barriers as night fell, with umbrellas pointed forward to shield their identities and ward off any police move to clear them.Some nearby stores shuttered early as police in riot gear gathered nearby ahead of the all but inevitable clearing operation.The rally in Chater Garden was called to protest the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other force to break up a protest the previous Sunday.\"We need to have a protest to show that we are strongly against this kind of brutality and we need them to respond to our demands,\" said rally organizer Ventus Lau.Police had denied Lau's request to march west to the Sheung Wan district, where the tear gas was used the previous weekend, citing escalating violence in clashes with protesters that have broken out after past marches and rallies.\"The police must prevent aggressive protesters from exploiting a peaceful procession to cause troubles and violent clashes,\" said Superintendent Louis Lau of the police public relations branch.On Saturday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as demonstrators threw bricks and other objects and ducked behind makeshift shields at a march in an outlying district toward the border with mainland China.Police had also denied permission for that protest in Yuen Long, where a mob apparently targeting demonstrators had beaten people brutally in a train station the previous weekend.Police wearing helmets charged into the same train station, where a few hundred protesters had taken refuge from the tear gas. Some officers swung their batons at demonstrators, while others appeared to be urging their colleagues to hang back. For the second week in a row, blood was splattered on the station floor.Police arrested 13 people, including march organizer Max Chung, for offenses including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assault, according to police and Hong Kong media. At least four officers were injured.The Hospital Authority said 24 people were taken to five hospitals. As of Sunday morning, eight remained hospitalized, two in serious condition.Amnesty International, the human rights group, called the police response heavy-handed and unacceptable.\"While police must be able to defend themselves, there were repeated instances today where police officers were the aggressors,\" Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said in a statement.Police said they had to use what they termed \"appropriate force\" because of the bricks and other objects thrown at them, including glass bottles with a suspected corrosive fluid inside.", "Hong Kong protesters target police use of force in march,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,28,2019": "HONG KONG--A sea of black-shirted protesters, some with bright yellow helmets and masks but many with just backpacks, marched down a major street in central Hong Kong on Sunday in the latest rally in what has become a summer of protest.The march followed a short rally at Chater Garden, a park in the financial district, against the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other force to break up a protest the previous Sunday.Police had denied permission to the organizers to march to the Sheung Wan district, where the tear gas was used.

One group surrounded and vandalized a police vehicle, causing danger to officers on board, a police statement said.Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets as demonstrators threw bricks and other objects and ducked behind makeshift shields.Later, police wearing helmets charged into the train station, where a few hundred protesters had taken refuge from the tear gas.

Demonstrators threw objects and ducked behind makeshift shields, and police officers shot plumes of tear gas into the air.For the protesters, it was a show of defiance against both the police and the white-clad assailants who beat dozens of people July 21, including some demonstrators heading home after a mass protest.Police said some of the attackers at the train station were connected to triad gangs and others were villagers who live in the area. Demonstrators accused law enforcement of not acting quickly enough to protect the victims and even colluding with the mob, an allegation that police have firmly denied.The streets of Yuen Long became a sea of umbrellas as the march began Saturday afternoon. A symbol going back to the Occupy Central protests that shook Hong Kong in 2014, umbrellas have become tools to help protesters conceal their identities from police cameras as well as shields against tear gas and pepper spray. Some also wore masks.\"Hong Kong police know the law and break the law,\" protesters chanted as they made their way through the streets.Max Chung Kin-ping, one of the rally's organizers, said there were 288,000 participants. The police had yet to release their turnout figure, which is generally lower than organizers' estimates.Less than three hours after the start of the march, police fired tear gas to try to disperse crowds that had ignored authorities' appeals to leave the area. Police said in a statement that they were clearing out the protesters, who were \"holding iron poles, self-made shields and even removing fences from roads.\"Some protesters also endangered police officers' lives by surrounding and vandalizing an occupied police vehicle, the statement added.As the demonstration rolled into the evening, officers in riot gear faced off with protesters using pieces of wood as shields. Live footage from broadcaster RTHK showed protesters on one street forcing back riot police by throwing umbrellas and waving rods at them. On another street, officers repeatedly raised warnings and fired tear gas at masked demonstrators who were standing their ground.Soon afterward, many of the protesters dispersed, but others stayed put. A group of officers appeared with batons and held up banners that read, \"Stop charging or we use force.\" At least one woman was knocked down when police used the rods.Later in the evening, protesters encircled a smashed-up car. The windows of the car were shattered and its body was covered with posters denouncing the police. It was not immediately clear who owned the vehicle or who destroyed it.By the waning hours of Saturday, some protesters remained in and around Yuen Long station. Police warned in a statement that they risked arrest.\"Police hereby reiterate that the protesters are participating in an unauthorized assembly and may be liable to a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment,\" the statement said.Late Saturday night, police wearing heavy-duty helmets and wielding batons suddenly charged into the train station, where a few hundred protesters had taken refuge from the tear gas.Some officers swung their batons directly at demonstrators, while others appeared to be urging their colleagues to hang back. For the second week in a row, blood was splattered on the station floor.A few hours before the march started, a man was arrested in Yuen Long for injuring someone with a knife, police said.Massive demonstrations began in Hong Kong early last month against an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to face trial in mainland China, where critics say their rights would be compromised. The bill was eventually suspended, but protesters' demands have grown to include direct elections, the dissolution of the current legislature and an investigation into alleged police brutality.A former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under the framework of \"one country, two systems.\" The arrangement promises the city certain democratic freedoms that are not afforded mainland citizens, but some residents say these liberties have been steadily eroded in recent years after the arrests of booksellers and democracy activists.A distrust of China's Communist Party-led central government in Beijing has undergirded the protests this summer. After the march last weekend, a group of protesters vandalized Hong Kong's Liaison Office, which represents the mainland government. They spray-painted the building's surveillance cameras and threw eggs and black ink at the Chinese national emblem, an act that Beijing has vehemently condemned.Some Yuen Long residents participated in Saturday's march, while others stood outside with signs warning protesters not to enter. For their part, demonstrators pasted calls for democracy on sticky notes around the area.\"After the violence (last Sunday), as a resident of Yuen Long, I think I have the responsibility to come out,\" said a 24-year-old man surnamed Man. \"After all these protests in past months, the government still hasn't responded to us.\"", "INSIGHT--Chinese official urged Hong Kong villagers to drive off protesters before violence at train station,REUTERS,July,27,2019": "HONG KONG--A week before suspected triad gang members attacked protesters and commuters at a rural Hong Kong train station last Sunday, an official from China's representative office urged local residents to drive away any activists.Li Jiyi, the director of the Central Government Liaison's local district office made the appeal at a community banquet for hundreds of villagers in Hong Kong's rural New Territories.In a previously unreported recording from the July 11 event obtained by Reuters, Li addresses the large crowd about the escalating protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its worst political crisis since it returned to Chinese from British rule in 1997.Li chastises the protesters, appealing to the assembled residents to protect their towns in Yuen Long district and to chase anti-government activists away.\"We won't allow them to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble,\" he said, to a burst of applause.\"Even though there are a group of protesters trained to throw bricks and iron bars, we still have a group of Yuen Long residents with the persistence and courage to maintain social peace and protect our home.\"Repeatedly, Li spoke of the need for harmony and unity between the traditional villages and the government, \"especially when there is wind and rain in Hong Kong\".The banquet was attended by a Hong Kong government district officer, Enoch Yuen, and many of the city's rural leaders.Responding to Reuters' questions to Yuen, a spokesman for the Yuen Long district office said it had no comment on the remarks of other speakers.\"District offices would relay local information and concerns gathered to other departments, as appropriate,\" he added.Last Sunday, after anti-government protesters marched in central Hong Kong and defaced China's Liaison Office, over 100 men swarmed through Yuen Long train station, attacking black-clad protesters, passers-by, journalists and a lawmaker with pipes, clubs and lamp stands.When some protesters retaliated, the beatings escalated as men and women were hit repeatedly on their heads and bodies by the masked men, who wore white shirts.Video footage showed victims fleeing the mayhem amid screams, and floors of the train station streaked with blood. Forty-five people were injured, one critically.China's Liaison Office did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about Li's speech, and Li could not be reached for comment.In a statement on its website dated Friday, the Liaison Office rejected what it called false rumors linking it to the violence in Yuen Long, although the statement did not address Li's speech.Johnny Mak, a veteran Democratic Alliance district councilor in Yuen Long who witnessed the train station bloodshed, said he believed Li's remarks had been an explicit call to arms against protesters.\"If he didn't say this, the violence wouldn't have happened, and the triads wouldn't have beaten people,\" he told Reuters in his office close to the station.Ching Chan-ming, the head of the Shap Pat Heung rural committee which hosted the banquet that night, said he thought Li's speech was positive and held no malicious intent.\"How could he (Li) make such an appeal like that?,\" Ching told Reuters. \"I don't think it was a mobilization call.

Several dozen people were arrested at the time.Within hours of Sunday's violence, police bosses battled criticism they had failed to protect the public given delays getting to the scene.Police commissioner Stephen Lo said there had been a need to \"redeploy manpower from other districts\".Democratic Party district councilor Zachary Wong said Li's message was having an impact in the days leading up to Sunday's violence and he had received repeated calls from associates a day earlier saying something was brewing.Wong said he called local police on Saturday, and then again on Sunday at 7 p.m. when he heard of men gathering in a Yuen Long park.\"Some people called me and said, 'We're really scared, please do something,\" Wong told Reuters.Both Mak and Wong said they were told by police they were aware of the situation and were handling it.During this time, pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho was filmed laughing and shaking hands with some of the men in white shirts near the park. Giving them the 'thumbs up' sign, he said: \"You are my heroes\". The men laughed and cheered in response.Ho later told reporters he had no knowledge of or involvement in the violence, but was merely reaching out to his constituents.Ho was not immediately available at his office and could not be reached on his mobile telephone.Several hours later, when the most violent assaults took place at the train station, there were still no police present to prevent the bloodshed.\"It doesn't make sense that for many hours, there wasn't a single police car in sight,\" said Mak.Two senior police officers involved in controlling demonstrations and a senior government security official told Reuters privately they were incensed at public perceptions the police somehow acted in concert with triads at Yuen Long.After the attacks in Yuen Long train station, some of the assailants fled to the traditional walled village of Nam Pin Wai nearby.There, riot police and other officers surrounded and questioned scores of men in white shirts for several hours, live media coverage showed.Sometime after 4 a.m., the men in white began to leave.

We are many,\" said one protester, who covered his face and declined to be named, as police nearby marshaled fans into the stadium.Over past months, Hong Kong has been embroiled by a series of sometimes violent protests--its most serious crisis since the city was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 but with democratic freedoms under a \"one country, two systems\" formula.Fresh conflicts broke out on Sunday in a widening crisis over an extradition bill that could see people from the territory sent to China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.Once Wednesday's game was under way, some fans sang \"Can you hear the people sing?\" and many in the 20,000 crowd began chanting \"Free Hong Kong.\"Others held up \"No Extradition\" signs calling on the Hong Kong government to categorically scrap the extradition bill rather than merely suspend it as they have done now.One man dressed in black, the preferred color worn by protesters, also ran onto the pitch, briefing disrupting the match towards the end.Manchester City easily won the game 6-1, including two goals from winger Leroy Sane, on a hot and humid night.Also on the scoresheet were David Silva, Raheem Sterling, Nabil Touaizi and Iker Pozo in front of a disappointing turnout of just under 21,000 at Hong Kong Stadium.City manager Pep Guardiola had earlier said protests affected him at a human level.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.While Washington has no formal ties with democratic Taiwan, it is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.The Chinese ministry said the United States had \"provoked intensified competition among major countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure ... and undermined global strategic stability.\"Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said later in a statement that Beijing's \"provocative behavior ... seriously violated the peace principle in international laws and relations, challenging regional safety and order.\"\"We urge Beijing authorities to renounce irrational, malicious acts such as the use of force, and to improve cross-strait relations and handle issues including Hong Kong rationally, so that it can be a responsible regional member,\" it said.In Beijing, asked how China's military would handle escalating protest violence in Hong Kong's widening crisis over a contentious extradition bill, Wu referred only to the territory's garrison law, which he said \"already has a clear stipulation.\"That law states that the Hong Kong government can request the People's Liberation Army (PLAN) garrison's assistance to maintain public order.But legal scholars say it is a very high threshold, and some retired security officials say any involvement by PLAN units in Hong Kong security would shatter the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which the former British colony returned to China in 1997.Wu also said reports of a secret pact with Cambodia granting China's armed forces exclusive access to part of the Southeast Asian nation's Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand were \"not in accordance with the facts.\"\"China and Cambodia have in the past carried out positive exchanges and cooperation on military drills, personnel training and logistics,\" he said. \"This kind of cooperation does not target any third party.\"", "China says U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0098power politics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 undermines global stability,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,25,2019": "BEIJING--China on Wednesday accused the United States of undermining global stability with unilateral policies and \"power politics\" as the Defense Ministry issued the first comprehensive outline of its policies since President Xi Jinping came to power more than six years ago.The United States was the first country mentioned in the document's opening section about \"prominent destabilizing factors\" and \"profound changes\" in the international security environment.\"The U.S. has adjusted its national security and defense strategies, and adopted unilateral policies,\" China said in the document. \"It has provoked and intensified competition among countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure ... and undermined global strategic stability.\"It's the 10th white paper of its kind since 1998.

While highlighting China's \"defensive\" approach, the report also pledged to \"surely counterattack if attacked.\"China's paramilitary police have helped Xinjiang authorities \"take out 1,588 violent terrorist gangs and capture 12,995 terrorists,\" the report said. The United States, independent analysts and human rights groups have estimated that around 1 million Muslims have been detained in internment camps as part of what the government calls a counterterrorism campaign.Former Uighur and Kazakh detainees and their families have accused China of punishing religious expression and separating children from their parents. They say members of their predominantly Muslim ethnic groups have been arbitrarily detained and subject to political indoctrination.China has long called the Dalai Lama a dangerous separatist. But the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader maintains that he only wants a greater degree of autonomy for the region.Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said the threat of Taiwan separatism is growing and warned that those who are seeking the democratic island's independence will meet a dead end.\"If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will certainly fight, resolutely defending the country's sovereign unity and territorial integrity,\" Wu said.Taiwan split from the Communist Party-ruled mainland China amid civil war in 1949. China maintains that Taiwan is part of its territory and seeks \"complete reunification.\"The United States has repeatedly raised Beijing's ire by selling arms to Taiwan. While the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with the island, U.S. law requires that it provide Taiwan with sufficient defense equipment and services for self-defense.Earlier this month, the United States tentatively approved the sale of $2.2 billion (237 billion yen) in arms to Taiwan--a proposal that had prompted China to threaten sanctions against the United States. Taiwan's defense ministry said it made the request in light of a growing military threat from China.\"The Western world, led by the United States, continues to strengthen its ability to contain China,\" said Hong Kong-based military analyst Song Zhongping. U.S. actions on Taiwan, the South China Sea, North Korea and Iran have all contributed to making the United States the \"initiator\" of China's security concerns, he said.The release of the white paper at this time is to \"warn the Taiwan independence forces and relevant parties in the United States that they should not underestimate China's determination,\" Song said.The white paper also pointed to U.S., Japanese and Australian moves to beef up their military presence and alliances in the Asia-Pacific as bringing uncertainties to the region.The U.S. deployment of a missile defense system in South Korea has severely undermined the regional strategic balance, the report said. It further noted Japan's reinterpretation of its post-World War II Constitution to allow its military to operate farther from its shores.China's military expansion in recent years has prompted concerns among other Pacific countries in a region long dominated by the U.S. Navy. China's development of anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles in particular has been seen as an effort to deter U.S. military and naval access to parts of the Asia-Pacific region.\"China exercises its national sovereignty to build infrastructure and deploy necessary defensive capabilities on the islands and reefs in the South China Sea, and to conduct patrols in the waters of the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea,\" the white paper said, referring to disputed waters as well as islands that Japan calls the Senkaku Islands.", "Hong Kong arrests men with gang links over mob attack,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,24,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police say they've arrested six men, some with links to triad gangs, following a violent attack on pro-democracy protesters at a subway station over the weekend that saw dozens injured.Senior police official Chan Tin-chu said the men, aged 24-54, were held for \"unlawful assembly\" and are being investigated for taking part in the attack late Sunday night. Some of them are villagers, and their occupations range from drivers and hawkers to renovation workers, he said.\"Some of them have triad backgrounds,\" he said. \"I believe that more ... will be detained soon. Police will not condone any form of violence.\"Police are still investigating the motive for the attack, Chan said, without providing further details on the alleged links to the triads, which refer to powerful organized crime syndicates in Hong Kong. The triads control certain neighborhoods in the city and are believed to have strong political influence.A gang of white-clad men armed with metal rods and wooden poles beat up anti-government protesters and others inside a subway station in Hong Kong's Yuen Long neighborhood late Sunday, injuring 45 people, including a man who remained in critical condition.More than 100,000 people took part in the latest rally in the city earlier that day to demand democracy and an investigation into the use of force by police to disperse crowds at the summer-long protests. Some protesters on Sunday directed their ire at China, pelting its office in Hong Kong with eggs, spray-painting a wall and defacing the Chinese national emblem.As demonstrators made their way home, the white-clad men descended on a group of them at the subway station. Videos showed them charging into the trains and beating up people who tried to defend themselves with umbrellas.Police have come under fire for being slow to respond to the violence against the protesters. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said police were stretched thin due to the massive crowds and denied accusations that her government colluded with the assailants.The assault escalated a crisis that had thrown the former British colony into turmoil after millions of people took to the streets in waves of protest against an extradition bill that would send suspects for trial in China. Critics see it as rising Chinese influence and fear it will chip away at Hong Kong's freedoms promised under a \"one country, two system\" formula since it returned to China in 1997.More protests have been planned, but the latest violence has fueled fears that China's People's Liberation Army may intervene.", "Li Peng, Chinese premier during Tiananmen crackdown, dies,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,24,2019": "BEIJING--Li Peng, a former hard-line Chinese premier best known for announcing martial law during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests that ended with a bloody crackdown by troops, has died. He was 90.China's official Xinhua News Agency said Li died Monday of an unspecified illness. His death was not announced until Tuesday evening.Li, a keen political infighter, spent two decades at the pinnacle of power before retiring in 2002. He left behind a legacy of prolonged and broad-based economic growth coupled with authoritarian political controls.While broadly disliked by the public, he oversaw China's reemergence from post-Tiananmen isolation to rising global diplomatic and economic clout, a development he celebrated in public statements that often were defiantly nationalistic.\"Ridding themselves from the predicament of imperialist bullying, humiliation and oppression, the calamity-trodden Chinese people have since stood up,\" Li said in 1995 in a speech for the Oct. 1 anniversary of the 1949 revolution that brought the ruling Communist Party to power.One reminder of Li will likely stand for ages to come: During his final years in power, he pushed through approval for his pet project \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the gargantuan $22 billion Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which forced 1.3 million people to leave homes that were swallowed up by its enormous reservoir.Li, who became acting premier in November 1987, triumphed over pro-reform party leader Zhao Ziyang in 1989 after the fellow native of Sichuan province was toppled from power for sympathizing with the student protesters at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\"The situation will not develop as you wish and expect,\" an angry Li told student leaders in a confrontational meeting on May 18, 1989.The next night, Li, flushed with anger, went on national television to announce martial law in Beijing.\"The anarchic state is going from bad to worse,\" he said. \"We are forced to take resolute and decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil.\"On the night of June 3-4, troops invaded the city, killing hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Beijing residents on their way to ending the student occupation of Tiananmen Square.China acknowledged Li's role, but in a positive way, in a lengthy eulogy read Tuesday night by a newscaster on state broadcaster CCTV.Li joined the majority of the leadership in taking \"resolute measures to prevent turmoil, quell the counter-revolutionary riots and stabilize the domestic situation,\" the eulogy read in part. \"He played an important role in the great struggle that concerns the future and destiny of the party and the nation.\"Li stepped down as premier in 1998, becoming chairman of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. He retired from the party's seven-member ruling Standing Committee in 2002 as part of a long-planned handover of power to a younger generation of leaders headed by Hu Jintao.In his later years, Li rarely appeared in public, and was usually seen only at official gatherings aimed at displaying unity, such as the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army in 2007.As his profile waned, he reportedly began lobbying older colleagues to support his children's political ambitions. One of his two sons, Li Xiaopeng, was the governor of Shanxi province before becoming transport minister in 2016.Li returned to the headlines in 2010 when a Hong Kong publisher announced he had Li's purported memoir on the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The publisher later halted the book's release, claiming copyright problems, but supposed excerpts of the diaries were leaked online.A cautious and uninspiring figure, Li was one of the few leaders to inspire real dislike among the nation's masses, although he was said to inspire loyalty among his subordinates.Born in October 1928 in Chengdu, a city in southwestern China, he was adopted by the late Premier Zhou Enlai after Li's father, an early communist revolutionary, was killed by the rival Nationalists in 1931.He shrugged off questions of nepotism, saying he was one of many war orphans cared for by Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao. But he did say that \"their ideals and moral influence had a profound influence on my upbringing.\"Li joined the Communist Party in 1945 after joining Zhou, Mao Zedong and others at their wartime guerrilla base of Yan'an in the northwest.After spending six years as an engineering student in Moscow, Li worked as an engineer for a decade in northeastern China.He was named director of the Beijing Electric Power Administration in 1966, and according to official biographies, was responsible for ensuring a stable power supply to Beijing and Tianjin during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.Li headed what was called the \"power industry family.\" His daughter Li Xiaolin was a prominent figure in the state power sector. Her retirement as CEO of China Power International Development in 2015 was seen by some as part of current Chinese President Xi Jinping's moves to uproot leaders' children from highly visible positions in the state sector.Li rose quickly after 1979, and in 1985 became a member of the party's decision-making Politburo with an education portfolio.It was in that role that he established himself as a conservative, telling students in 1985 that China can never become capitalist: \"To allow bourgeois freedoms would only make our country's affairs chaotic.\"His tough stance when students staged pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities in late 1986 and early 1987 helped him win a post on the powerful Politburo Standing Committee, leading to his showdown with the reform-minded Zhao over Tiananmen in 1989.", "Ivory from nearly 300 elephants seized in record haul,REUTERS,July,23,2019": "SINGAPORE--Singapore said on Tuesday it had seized 8.8 tons of elephant ivory, a record haul by authorities in the city-state, which conservation groups say is a transit point for the illegal wildlife trade.The elephant ivory, estimated to be worth $12.9 million (1.4 billion yen), came from nearly 300 African elephants, and was heading to Vietnam through Singapore from Democratic Republic of the Congo.The haul also contained the third major seizure of pangolin scales in Singapore this year.The pangolin, a scaly anteater, is one of the most trafficked mammals in the world. Its meat is considered a delicacy in Vietnam and China, and the scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine, though the benefits are disputed by medical scientists.\"The seized pangolin scales and elephant ivory will be destroyed to prevent them from re-entering the market,\" the Singapore Customs, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and the National Parks Board said, adding that the July 21 seizure came after a tip-off from China's customs department.The ivory haul falls just short of 9.1 tons seizure in Vietnam in March, which nongovernmental organization Environmental Investigation Agency said was thought to be the largest ever globally.There has been a flurry of seizures, including of rhino horns, in Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam in recent months.\"Singapore has always been inadvertently implicated in the global ivory trade for two reasons: its global connectivity, as well as the presence of a small domestic market where pre-1990s ivory can be legally sold,\" said Kim Stengert, chief communications officer for WWF Singapore.\"The consistency of these large-scale seizures is strong evidence of organized crime behind illegal wildlife trade coming through or into Singapore.\"Singapore authorities said the latest seizure also contained 11.9 tons of pangolin scales, worth about $35.7 million and equivalent to close to 2,000 pangolins.Singapore has seized a total of 37.5 tons of pangolin scales since April, including one raid which was the biggest of its kind worldwide in five years.The city-state is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and says it is committed to the global effort to curb the illegal wildlife trade.", "Hong Kong crisis escalates after mob attack on protesters,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,23,2019": "HONG KONG--An overnight attack by white-clad assailants apparently targeting pro-democracy protesters raised tensions to new levels in Hong Kong on Monday as China harshly criticized the weekend demonstration, saying \"central authority cannot be challenged.\"The Chinese rebuke came after its Hong Kong office was targeted Sunday night by protesters who pelted it with eggs and spray-painted its walls. It made no mention of the violent attack hours later at a subway station by men wielding iron pipes and wooden poles as they beat up people clad in the pro-democracy movement's black shirts. Dozens were injured.The attack on China's Liaison Office was an escalation of the weekslong protests, during which demonstrators besieged Hong Kong's legislature and police headquarters but did not direct their ire at China itself. It came after more than 100,000 people marched through the city to demand democracy and an investigation into the use of force by police to disperse crowds at protests.As demonstrators made their way home, a gang of men descended on a group of them at a subway station. Video of the attack in Hong Kong's Yuen Long neighborhood showed the protesters being beaten by the assailants as they retreated into the trains, intimidated by the gangs of men waiting for them outside the turnstiles. The attackers then entered the trains and beat the people inside as they tried to defend themselves with umbrellas.At least 45 people were injured, and 15 remained hospitalized Monday afternoon, including one man in critical condition, the Hospital Authority said.Subway passengers filmed by Stand News and iCABLE angrily accused police officers of not intervening to protect the demonstrators, who have been critical of the police use of force.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Monday that allegations that police had colluded with the assailants were \"unfounded.\"The Sunday night assault on Beijing's Hong Kong Liaison Office touched a raw nerve in China. China's national emblem, which hangs on the front of the building, was splattered with black ink. It was replaced by a new one within hours.The official People's Daily newspaper, in a front-page commentary on Monday headlined \"Central Authority Cannot Be Challenged,\" called the protesters' actions \"intolerable.\"\"These acts openly challenged the authority of the central government and touched the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,\" the government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said in a statement Sunday.Lam repeated the same statement to reporters Monday, adding that the vandalism \"hurt the nation's feelings.\"The \"one country, two systems\" framework, under which the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, allows Hong Kong to maintain a fair degree of autonomy in local affairs. Demonstrators fear the pro-Beijing government in Hong Kong is chipping away at their rights and freedoms, and the weekslong tumult has fueled fears of a more aggressive Chinese response.In Washington, President Donald Trump said he believes Chinese leader Xi Jinping has acted \"very responsibly\" in allowing the extended protests to play out in Hong Kong. Asked about China's handling of the protests, he said that \"China could stop them if they wanted.\"\"I hope that President Xi will do the right thing. But it has been going on a long time,\" Trump added, without elaborating.Meanwhile, a group of pro-China lawmakers held a news conference appealing for a halt to the violence, saying it was a blow to Hong Kong's reputation and was scaring away tourists and investors.They also urged police to tighten enforcement against the protesters, whom Regina Ip, a former security secretary, called \"rebels.\"\"The violent attack on the Liaison Office ... is a direct affront to the sovereignty of our country,\" Ip said.Asked why it took at least a half-hour for police to arrive at the suburban train station where protesters were attacked, she said the police were \"overstretched.\"\"The police have been under extreme pressure,\" she said.Later Monday, the office of a pro-Beijing lawmaker was surrounded and vandalized by about 100 people who believed he had shaken hands the previous day with the attackers. Protesters wrote memos and stuck them on legislator Junius Ho's office, damaged glass panels at the entrance and destroyed a surveillance camera. No one appeared to be in the office.Meanwhile, pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said the Sunday night subway attack showed \"more than apparent\" involvement from the triad, a branch of organized crime in Hong Kong.\"What happened last night doesn't seem accidental in any way,\" Mo said. \"It's all organized.\"The growing crisis in Hong Kong has fueled fears that China's People's Liberation Army may intervene.A Chinese army brigade said Monday that it held an anti-terrorism exercise in southern Guangdong province. The 74th Army Group did not refer to Hong Kong in its social media statement, but military commentator and retired officer Yue Gang said that troops would be dispatched to the semi-autonomous territory if needed.\"To deface the Chinese national emblem is like acting as an enemy to 1.3 billion Chinese people,\" Yue said. \"They must be deterred.\"Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the nationalistic Global Times, warned against military intervention.\"If the People's Liberation Army helps to stabilize the situation, Hong Kong will benefit from law and order, but the public opinion won't buy it,\" Hu wrote in a commentary published on Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging service. The public will \"accuse Beijing of undermining 'one country, two systems,'\" he said.", "Hong Kong police criticised over failure to stop attacks on protesters,REUTERS,July,22,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police faced criticism on Monday for an apparent failure to protect anti-government protesters and passersby from attack by what opposition politicians suspected were gang members at a train station on the weekend.The attack on Sunday came during a night of escalating violence that opened new fronts in Hong Kong's widening political crisis over an extradition bill, that could see people sent to China for trial.Protesters had earlier on Sunday surrounded China's main representative office in the city and defaced walls and signs and clashed with police.The city's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, condemned the attack on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main office in the city, the Central Government Liaison Office, saying it was a \"challenge\" to national sovereignty.She condemned violent behaviour of any kind and said she had been shocked by the clashes at the station, adding police would investigate fully.\"Violence will only breed more violence,\" Lam said while flanked by senior city officials.Some politicians and activists have linked Hong Kong's shadowy network of triad criminal gangs to political intimidation and violence in recent years, sometimes against pro-democracy activists and critics of Beijing.On Sunday night, scores of men in white T-shirts, some armed with clubs, flooded into the rural Yuen Long station, and stormed a train, attacking passengers with pipes, poles and other objects, according to video footage.Witnesses, including Democratic lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, said the men appeared to target black-shirted passengers who had been at an anti-government march.Lawmaker Lam, who was wounded in the face and hospitalised, said the police ignored calls he made, pleading with them to intervene to prevent bloodshed.\"They deliberately turned a blind eye to these attacks by triads on regular citizens,\" he told Reuters, saying the floors of the station were streaked with blood.\"I won't speculate on why they didn't help immediately,\" he said.Forty-five people were injured in the violence at the station, with one in critical condition, according to hospital authorities.Hong Kong's police chief Stephen Lo, asked about concern police had been slow to respond to the clash at the station, said there had been a need to \"redeploy manpower from other districts\".Police stations nearby had closed given the risk of unrest, and a patrol on the scene needed to wait for reinforcements, he said.\"We will pursue at all costs to bring the offenders to justice,\" he told reporters, while pledging to restore public confidence in the police force.Asked by a reporter if police had colluded with triads at the station, Lo said the force had no links to triads.Witnesses saw groups of men in white with poles and bamboo staves at a nearby village but police later found no weapons and allowed the men to leave without making any arrests.\"We can't say you have a problem because you are dressed in white and we have to arrest you,\" said Yau Nai-keung, an assistant police commander in the area.\"We will treat them fairly no matter which camp they are in,\" Yau said.Some banks and shops in the area closed early on Monday amid fears of more trouble.Hong Kong's anti-triad police units in 2014 investigated the role of triad gangs attacking protesters during the pro-democracy demonstrations that shut down parts of the city for 79 days that year.Alvin Yeung, a barrister and lawmaker with the pro-democracy Civic Party, said he was sure the men were from gangs.\"I hope that the police will not deceive themselves,\" Yeung said. \"It is a triad fight, and not a normal confrontation.\"Hong Kong has been rocked by a series of sometimes violent protests for more than two months in its most serious crisis since Britain handed the Asian financial hub back to Chinese rule in 1997.Under the terms of the handover, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.Many city residents fear that the proposed extradition law, which would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party, would undermine Hong Kong's judicial independence.The city's Beijing-backed government, responding the scale of the protests, postponed it and later said it was \"dead\" but the protesters are demanding its full withdrawal, and calling on city leader Lam to resign - something she has declined to do.They are also demanding independent inquiries into the use of the police against protesters. Some are also demanding full democracy - anathema to Beijing's party leadership.On Sunday, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse activists after thousands had ringed Beijing's Liaison Office.The police said in statement that protesters hurled bricks, smoke grenades and petrol bombs during the unrest that came after hundreds of thousands marched through the city streets.The Chinese government, including office director Wang Zhimin, condemned the turmoil, which included spray-painting and hurling eggs at walls and a national emblem at the office, saying the behaviour challenged the \"authority and dignity\" of the Chinese government.A foreign ministry spokesman said such acts tested Beijing's limits.\"Some radical protestor behaviour violated our bottom line of 'one country, two systems'.

They then headed for the Liaison Office, which represents China's Communist Party-led central government within the city.Protesters threw eggs at the building and spray-painted its surrounding surveillance cameras. China's national emblem, which adorns the front of the Liaison Office, was splattered with black ink. The Liaison Office said in comments published on Chinese state media that the acts \"openly challenged the authority of the central government and touched the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle.\"Later, police threw tear gas canisters at protesters to try to disperse them. Protesters scattered, some heading back in the direction of a key business and retail district. Police remained in place, protecting themselves with shields. Police said on their official social media accounts that protesters threw bricks and petrol bombs at them and attacked the Central police station.Hong Kong media released video showing masked assailants attacking commuters in a subway station. Among those attacked were protesters clad in their trademark black clothing and yellow hard hats.The attackers, meanwhile, were dressed in white with black masks pulled over their heads. On Saturday, demonstrators wore white at a counter-rally in support of police.Footage from Apple Daily showed the attackers using umbrellas to beat people in the station and inside a subway car. Subway passengers filmed by Stand News and iCABLE angrily accused police officers of not intervening in the attack. Stand News reporter Gwyneth Ho said on Facebook that she suffered minor injuries to her hands and shoulder, and was dizzy from a head injury. The South China Morning Post reported several people were bleeding following the attacks, and that seven people were sent to the hospital.The Hong Kong government said in a statement shortly after midnight that commuters were attacked at a subway station in the city's Yuen Long neighborhood, leading to \"confrontations and injuries.\"The statement also said some \"radical protesters initiated a series of violent acts ... despite repeated warnings\" by police. They said the acts included hurling petrol bombs, setting fires and throwing bricks.\"This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law,\" the statement said, referring to the acts of the subway attackers as well as the protesters.Organizers said 430,000 people participated in Sunday's march, while police said there were 138,000 during the procession's \"peak period.\"Large protests began early last month in opposition to a contentious extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to stand trial in mainland China, where critics say their rights would be compromised.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has declared the extradition bill dead, but protesters are dissatisfied with her refusal to formally withdraw the legislation. Some are also calling for her to resign amid growing concerns about the steady erosion of civil rights in the city.Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997 and was promised certain democratic freedoms under the framework of \"one country, two systems.\" Fueled by anger at Lam and an enduring distrust of the Communist Party-ruled central government in Beijing, the current demonstrations have ballooned into calls for electoral reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality at the protests.Walking in sweltering heat, protesters dressed in black kicked off Sunday's march at a public park, carrying a large banner that read \"Independent Inquiry for Rule of Law.\"\"Free Hong Kong! Democracy now!\" the protesters chanted, forming a dense procession through Wan Chai as they were joined by others who had been waiting in side streets.\"The government has never responded to our demands,\" said Karen Yu, a 52-year-old Hong Kong resident who has attended four protests since they started. \"No matter how much the government can do, at least it should come out and respond to us directly.\"Protesters repeated the five points of their \"manifesto,\" which was first introduced when a small group of them stormed the legislature earlier this month. Their main demands include universal suffrage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 direct voting rights for all Hong Kong residents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as dropping charges against anti-extradition protesters, withdrawing the characterization of a clash between police and protesters as a \"riot\" and dissolving the Legislative Council.Protesters read the demands aloud in both English and Cantonese in videos released Saturday.\"We did not want to embark on this path of resisting tyranny with our bare bodies,\" they said, \"but for too long, our government has lied and deceived, and refused to respond to the demands of the people.\"While the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, some confrontations between police and protesters have turned violent. In Sha Tin district the previous Sunday, they beat each other with umbrellas and bats inside a luxury shopping center. Demonstrators broke into the Legislative Council building on July 1 by moving past barricades and shattering windows.On Friday, Hong Kong police discovered a stash of a powerful homemade explosive and arrested a man in a raid on a commercial building.

Nearby, activists daubed graffiti on massive concrete pillars leading up to it, with the words \"Restore Hong Kong, Revolution of Time.\"Sunday's protest, which had proceeded peacefully along the police-mandated route, is the latest in a wave of unrest that has plunged the Asian financial hub into political crisis.Some held up banners that said, \"LIAR\" and \"No excuse Carrie Lame.\" A poster plastered on a lamppost called for an \"Investigation on police brutality.\"Many ignored the official end-point of the rally as the demonstrations show no sign of let-up, posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012.Authorities used blue and white water-filled barriers to barricade government and police headquarters, while global bank HSBC, in a rare move, pulled down large metal barriers on the street level of its gleaming skyscraper building.While most of the rallies have passed off peacefully, some have erupted into violence late at night when more radical protesters have clashed with police.The city's police force has come under scrutiny after officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas last month to disperse demonstrators in some of the worst violence to roil Hong Kong in decades.The police are struggling to cope amid haphazard decision-making, worsening morale and anger among rank-and-file officers that they are taking the public heat for government unpopularity, serving and retired officers, politicians and security analysts told Reuters.The latest protest comes a day after tens of thousands gathered to voice support for the police, whom some have accused of using excessive force against activists, and demand an end to the violence.Sunday's march focused on calls for the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, which would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial, and an independent investigation into complaints of police brutality.Other demands include charges against protesters to be dropped and universal suffrage.\"I came back to Hong Kong this summer because of the protests,\" said Mandy Ko, 27, who is originally from Hong Kongand now lives in Australia.\"My spirit is still with Hong Kong people.\"Last weekend, two initially peaceful protests degenerated into running skirmishes between baton-wielding police and activists, resulting in scores of injuries and more than 40 arrests.Those fights followed larger outbreaks of violence in central Hong Kong last month, when police forced back activists with tear gas, rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds.Lam has apologised for the turmoil the extradition bill has caused and declared it \"dead.\" Opponents of the bill, which they fear could be used to silence dissent, say nothing short of its withdrawal will do.Under the terms of the handover from Britain in 1997, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest.But for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.The protests have at times paralysed parts of the financial district, shut government offices and disrupted business operations across the city. Officials have also warned about the impact of the unrest on the economy.A commentary published in the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper on Sunday said: \"If violence continues, it will inevitably deal a greater blow to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.\"China has condemned the violent protests as an \"undisguised challenge\" to the one country, two systems formula.Police late on Friday seized explosives and weapons in an industrial building in the New Territories district of Tsuen Wan.

China's national emblem, which adorns the front of the Liaison Office, was splattered with black ink.Large protests began last month in the Chinese territory in opposition to a contentious extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to stand trial in mainland China, where critics say their rights would be compromised.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has declared the bill dead, but protesters are dissatisfied with her refusal to formally withdraw the legislation. Some are also calling for her to resign amid growing concerns about the steady erosion of civil rights in the city.A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 and was promised certain democratic freedoms under the framework of \"one country, two systems.\" Fueled by anger at Lam and an enduring distrust of the Communist Party-ruled central government in Beijing, the current demonstrations have ballooned into calls for electoral reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality.Walking in sweltering heat, protesters dressed in black kicked off Sunday's march at a public park, carrying a large banner that read \"Independent Inquiry for Rule of Law.\"\"Free Hong Kong! Democracy now!\" the protesters chanted, forming a dense procession through Hong Kong's Wan Chai district as they were joined by others who had been waiting in side streets.\"I think the government has never responded to our demands,\" said Karen Yu, a 52-year-old Hong Kong resident who has attended four protests since they started in early June. \"No matter how much the government can do, at least it should come out and respond to us directly.\"Marchers ignored orders from police to finish off the procession on a road in Wan Chai, according to police and the Civil Human Rights Front, the march's organizers.Protesters repeated the five points of their \"manifesto,\" which was first introduced when a small group of them stormed the legislature earlier this month. Their main demands include universal suffrage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 direct voting rights for all Hong Kongresidents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as dropping charges against anti-extradition protesters, withdrawing the characterization of a clash between police and protesters as a \"riot\" and dissolving the Legislative Council.Protesters read the demands aloud in both English and Cantonese in videos released Saturday.\"We did not want to embark on this path of resisting tyranny with our bare bodies,\" they said, \"but for too long, our government has lied and deceived, and refused to respond to the demands of the people.\"While the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, some confrontations between police and protesters have turned violent. In Sha Tin district last Sunday, they beat each other with umbrellas and bats inside a luxury shopping center. Demonstrators broke into the Legislative Council building on July 1 by moving past barricades and shattering windows. Meanwhile, police officers have used pepper spray, tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets to quell the crowds.On Friday, Hong Kong police discovered a stash of a powerful homemade explosive and arrested a man in a raid on a commercial building.

China also claims Taiwan as its territory, though the democratically governed island split from the Communist Party-ruled mainland amid civil war in 1949.Tsai spoke to reporters during a visit this week to Saint Lucia, an eastern Caribbean island nation that is among Taiwan's few remaining allies.

The company has accrued a mountain of debt - about $100 billion - after going on an acquisition spree, including buying Anheuser-Busch in 2008 and its next closest rival, SABMiller, in 2015.The SABMiller deal, which was worth some $107 billion at the time, gave the company broader reach in fast-growing markets in Asia and Africa at a time when consumers were shifting toward smaller brands like microbrews.It gave it almost a third of the global beer market and put established brands that had formerly been rivals under the same roof - American icons Budweiser and Miller, for example.AB Inbev has sought to shed some brands to slim down its debt load and had planned to list some shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to further bolster its finances.

Proceeds of crime are also laundered through the formal banking system in Singapore and Hong Kong, it added.Responding to the report, a Thai senator offered to join hands with the agency and other nations to fight the menace.\"We are ready to take a leadership role and work with UNODC and international partners to build resilience and address cross-border trafficking,\" said Prajin Juntong, who is also a former deputy prime minister.As evidence of the rise of organized crime, the report highlighted an explosion in production of the drug methamphetamine in Myanmar and its distribution across the Asia-Pacific, often concealed in tea packages.\"The Asia-Pacific meth market is now the biggest in the world,\" Jeremy Douglas, the agency's representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, told Reuters.\"Of all the organized crime types, meth trafficking is the most dangerous and the most profitable. It underpins the growing power of these transnational crime groups.\"The trade was worth between $30.3 billion and $61.4 billion (3.3 trillion and 6.6 trillion yen) last year, up from $15 billion in 2013, the agency said.The most valuable markets in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea make up $20 billion, or a third of the high-end estimate, it added.More than 12 million users in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand consumed about 320 tons of pure methamphetamine last year, the bulk from industrial-scale labs in northern Myanmar, it estimated.A record 120 tons was also seized by law enforcement, but falling prices show more reaches users than is impounded.Crystal meth, mostly consumed by middle-class party-goers in developed countries, is ingested in poorer countries as tablets mixed with caffeine, often to help users cope with grueling work in factories and construction sites.The purity of crystal meth, the most potent form, ranges between 50 and 90 percent, but in tablets it ranges from 15 to 25 percent.", "Hong Kong elders march in support of young demonstrators,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,18,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of Hong Kong senior citizens, including a popular actress, marched Wednesday in a show of support for youths at the forefront of monthlong protests against a contentious extradition bill in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.The seniors also slammed the police for their handling of a protest Sunday in Hong Kong's Sha Tin district. That protest was mostly peaceful but ended in mayhem when violent scuffles in a shopping mall saw dozens injured, including a policeman who had a finger bitten off, and over 40 people detained.Veteran actress and singer Deanie Ip, who joined Wednesday's demonstration, said police shouldn't use heavy-handed tactics against young protesters who \"have no guns\" and were peacefully expressing their frustrations.\"They are young people and they are doing the right thing. Why are they being mistreated?\" she said.Ip and several others held a banner reading \"Support youth to protect Hong Kong\" as they marched through a financial district. Wearing white tops and black pants, marchers held placards that read \"Never give up\" and \"Stay together.\"Dozens of seniors carried a 6-meter-long black banner that read \"Reject tyrannical rule.\"Some elders in wheelchairs also joined the march. Organizers said about 8,000 people participated in the demonstration.Hong Kong has been jolted for over a month by a series of large-scale and occasional violent protests amid widespread anger over a proposed extradition law that would send suspects to mainland China to face trials.

Tens of thousands have continued to take to the streets, with the protests expanding into a bigger movement against China's growing intrusion into the territory.The senior citizens Wednesday repeated demands for the legislation to be formally withdrawn, for the release of dozens of people detained and for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters.More protests have been planned, which could cause further instability in the global financial hub.Phil Chan, a senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm, said violent clashes between protesters and police could intensify unless the government starts to engage meaningfully with the people in meeting some of their demands, including the move toward universal suffrage.\"The government at present is merely engaging in verbal dissemblance,\" Chan said. \"As the political crisis drags on, it will become increasingly difficult for the Hong Kong government to resolve, and police-community relations will take a long time to heal.

Each time he felt the now-familiar sting, Wong, 18, was more determined to not back down.\"Every time we come out and stand up, problems continue to arise afterward,\" Wong said, referring to the protesters' dissatisfaction with responses from law enforcement and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam. \"Trust in the whole Hong Kong government is bankrupt.\"What began as a protest against an extradition bill has ballooned into a fundamental challenge to the way Hong Kong is governed--and the role of the Chinese government in the city's affairs. \"Hong Kong is not China\" has become a refrain of the movement in what is a Chinese territory, but with its own laws and a separate legal system under a \"one country, two systems\" framework.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Hong Kong in three marches last month to oppose the extradition legislation, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China, where critics fear they would face opaque charges and unfair trials.In recent weeks, the demonstrations have also included two smaller protests led by nativist-leaning groups against an influx of mainland Chinese into the city of 7.4 million people. All of it traces back to an underlying mistrust of the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities, which fuels calls for a more responsive government that protesters believe democracy would bring.When Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997, its residents were promised certain freedoms not afforded to mainland Chinese. Opponents of the extradition bill argued that a hallmark of the \"one country, two systems\" framework--Hong Kong's independent judicial system--would be compromised under the proposed legislation.Lam initially maintained that the bill would move forward, but has since declared them indefinitely suspended and \"dead.\" The protests, however, have continued unabated, as demonstrators call for Lam's resignation, the legislation's formal withdrawal and an investigation into police tactics. They also demand that protesters not be punished--as the leaders of the pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement\" demonstrations in 2014 were.Across these issues, protesters have increasingly held up signs expressing a broader wish: a yearning for greater democracy.Slogans such as \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Democracy Now\" have become more widely used, said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of a book about the city's recent protest history who has been attending the protests since they began.\"People are fundamentally saying that they don't trust the mainland Communist government,\" he said. \"There's an underlying anxiety and fear in Hong Kong of what they're going to do.\"Pro-democracy sentiment has become more pronounced in recent years as Hong Kong residents increasingly feel that Beijing, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is encroaching on their promised freedoms.A principal demand has been for \"universal suffrage,\" which means allowing Hong Kong citizens to vote directly for their chief executive and Legislative Council. The current chief executive, Lam, was chosen in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.Several events have fueled anxieties about eroding boundaries between Hong Kong and the mainland. Five Hong Kong booksellers disappeared and ended up in Chinese custody, and the 2014 protest leaders were sent to prison. Meanwhile, China has built a high-speed rail link between the mainland and Hong Kong and plans to include both in a \"Greater Bay Area,\" seen as attempts by Beijing to meld Hong Kong with the mainland.\"The furor over the extradition bill has since metamorphosed into a generalized movement uniting Hong Kong people of all ages and from all walks of life to express their frustrations and disappointments about an array of issues related to China,\" said Phil Chan, a senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm.Mainland Chinese traders, as well as middle-aged mainland women who sing and dance loudly in a public park, have also been targets of Hong Kong protesters.In what has become a recurring pattern, a demonstration Sunday in the northern district of Sha Tin was peaceful for most of the day, but scuffles broke out when police started clearing streets after nightfall. Some protesters retreated into a shopping complex where they and police hit each other with clubs and umbrellas.

He said they are now gearing up for a large protest this Sunday at the government complex in the Admiralty district.\"There is a reason that all of these citizens are standing up,\" said Wong, a recent high school graduate who plans to study design at university in the fall. \"We still have to work, we still have to study, we would like to have normal holidays.\"Instead, he has spent his summer break administering first aid to protesters and helping to document the events.\"I just can't imagine how this will end,\" he said.", "Hong Kong leader thanks police after clashes with \u00e2\u0080\u0098rioters\u00e2\u0080\u0099,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,16,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam thanked police on Monday after violent scuffles erupted between law enforcement officers and protesters demanding her resignation.A demonstration Sunday in Hong Kong's Sha Tin district was peaceful for most of the day, but fights broke out when police started clearing streets after nightfall.

"HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday protesters involved in the latest clashes with the police could be described as \"rioters\" and that she supported police upholding the law and seeking those responsible.Lam made the comments at a hospital where three police officers were being treated for injuries sustained in skirmishes on Sunday with demonstrators angry about a controversial extradition bill.Hong Kong has been rocked by large and sometimes violent street protests over the past month to oppose the extradition bill, plunging the former British colony into its biggest political crisis since it was handed back to China in 1997.On Sunday, an afternoon protest march attended by tens of thousands of people ended in chaos in a shopping mall, where scores of protesters threw umbrellas and plastic bottles at police who retaliated by firing pepper spray and swinging batons.Lam said more than 10 police were injured in skirmishes on Sunday, with six hospitalized.\"We thank the police officers for maintaining social order loyally and professionally, but they have suffered in attacks from those rioters--they can be called rioters,\" she said.The government information office said 28 people, including police, were injured in the latest protest.Police Chief Stephen Lo said late on Sunday more than 40 people were arrested for charges including assaulting police and illegal assembly.The extradition bill that sparked the protests would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial in courts controlled by the ruling Communist Party.Critics of the bill say that would threaten Hong Kong's rule of law and its place as an Asian financial hub.Demonstrations have drawn hundreds of thousands of people into the streets since early June.Under pressure, Lam suspended the bill in mid-June and last week declared it \"dead,\" but opponents say they will settle for nothing less than the formal withdrawal of the bill from the legislative process.Protesters have recently seized upon the widespread anger over the bill to draw attention to a litany of other issues, including the territory's relative lack of democracy and border traders from mainland China.They have also taken the movement out of the main business and government district on Hong Kong island to other spots around the territory, including the town of Sha Tin where the protest march and clashes happened on Sunday.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees its people freedoms

they see as an erosion of those freedoms and a relentless march toward mainland control.", "China Q2 GDP growth slows to 27-year low as trade war bites, more stimulus seen,REUTERS,July,15,2019": "BEIJING--China's economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure.While more upbeat June factory output and retail sales offered signs of improvement, some analysts cautioned the gains may not be sustainable, and expect Beijing will continue to roll out more support measures in coming months.China's trading partners and financial markets are closely watching the health of the world's second-largest economy as the Sino-U.S. trade war gets longer and costlier, fuelling worries of a global recession.Monday's growth data marked a loss of momentum for the economy from the first quarter's 6.4%, adding to expectations that Beijing needs to do more to boost consumption and investment and restore business confidence.The April-June pace, in line with analysts' expectations, was the slowest since the first quarter of 1992, the earliest quarterly data on record.\"China's growth could slow to 6% to 6.1% in the second half,\" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust. That would test the lower end of Beijing's 2019 target range of 6-6.5%.Cutting banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) \"is still very likely as the authorities want to support the real economy in the long run,\" he said, predicting the economy would continue to slow before stabilising around mid-2020.China has already slashed RRR six times since early 2018 to free up more funds for lending, and analysts polled by Reuters forecast two more cuts by the end of this year.Beijing has leaned largely on fiscal stimulus to underpin growth this year, announcing massive tax cuts worth nearly 2 trillion yuan ($291 billion) and a quota of 2.15 trillion yuan for special bond issuance by local governments aimed at boosting infrastructure construction.The economy has been slow to respond, however, and business sentiment remains cautious.Trade pressures have intensified since Washington sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods in May. While the two sides have since agreed to resume trade talks and hold off on further punitive action, they remain at odds over significant issues needed for an agreement.Despite the trade dispute, net exports accounted for a striking 20.7% of the first-half GDP growth, as Chinese exporters had rushed to sell ahead of higher U.S. tariffs and imports had weakened more sharply amid sagging domestic demand.For June, both exports and imports fell, and an official survey showed factories were shedding jobs at the fastest pace since the global crisis a decade ago..\"Due to the global slowdown and impact from the trade war, our exports will continue to fall and it's possible they may post zero growth for the year,\" said Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Centre, a top government think-tank.The contribution from net exports will decline as domestic demand gradually recovers, Zhu told the official Financial News ahead of the Q2 data, adding that he expects economic growth to slow to 5.8% next year.A string of downbeat data in recent months and the sudden escalation in the trade row had sparked questions over whether more forceful easing may be needed to get the economy back on steadier footing, including some form of interest rate cuts.China has \"tremendous\" room to adjust policies if the trade war worsens, the central bank governor was quoted as saying in June.Premier Li Keqiang said this month that China will make timely use of cuts in banks' reserve ratios and other financing tools to support smaller firms, while repeating a vow not to use \"flood-like\" stimulus.Analysts believe room for more aggressive monetary policy easing is being limited by fears of adding to high debt levels and structural risks.Moreover, June industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment data all beat analysts' forecasts, suggesting that Beijing's earlier growth-boosting efforts may be starting to have an effect.Industrial output climbed 6.3% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, picking up from May's 17-year low and handily beating an expected 5.2%.Daily output for crude steel and aluminium both rose to record levels.Retail sales jumped 9.8% - the fastest since March 2018 - and confounding expectations for a slight pullback to 8.3%. Gains were led by a 17.2% surge in car sales.Mao Shengyong, a spokesman at the National Bureau of Statistics, told a briefing that he expected the benefits of policy measures will be more obvious in the second half.Some analysts, however, questioned the apparent recovery in both output and sales.Capital Economics said its in-house model suggested slower industrial growth last month, while the jump in car sales may have been partly due to a one-off factor.Car dealers in China are offering big discounts to customers to reduce high inventories that have built up due to changing emission standards. Motor vehicle production actually fell 15.2%, the 11th monthly decline in a row, suggesting automakers don't expect a sustained bounce in demand any time soon.Fixed-asset investment for the first half of the year rose 5.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 5.5% forecast and 5.6% in the first five months. Infrastructure expanded 4.1%, with railways continuing to grow in the double digits.Real estate investment, a major growth driver, also quickened in June, rising 10.1% on-year, Reuters calculated. But new home sales shrank for a second month.\"The monthly data were better than expected... (But) we are sceptical of this apparent recovery given broader evidence of weakness in factory activity,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.\"Looking ahead, we doubt that the data for June will mark the start of a turnaround.\"($1 = 6.8779 Chinese yuan renminbi)", "Kaohsiung mayor tapped to run for Taiwan president in 2020,REUTERS,July,15,2019": "TAIPEI--The mayor of Taiwan's southern port city Han Kuo-yu on Monday won the opposition party's hotly contested nomination for the 2020 presidential election, posting a direct challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen who is seeking re-election.The China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) said Kaohsiung mayor Han beat four other contenders in a national tally for its primary race, including the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, Terry Gou.The self-ruled island is set to hold its presidential election in January amid heightened tension with China, which considers it a wayward province and has never ruled out the use of force to return it to the fold.Han gained island-wide popularity after winning the mayoral election in November in Kaohsiung, formerly a stronghold for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.The China-friendly mayor triggered controversy after his meetings with several senior officials in China earlier this year, including Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the People's Government in Hong Kong.Han has said both sides are part of \"one China,\" a cherished principle for Beijing, and has previously described Taiwan independence as being \"more scary\" than syphilis.Tsai's administration suffered a defeat in local elections late last year amid mounting criticism over the party's reform agenda and rising pressure from China.", "Hong Kong police fight with protesters amid rising tensions,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,15,2019": "HONG KONG--Police in Hong Kong fought with protesters on Sunday as they broke up a demonstration by thousands of people demanding the resignation of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's chief executive and an investigation into complaints of police violence.The protest in the northern district of Sha Tin was peaceful for most of the day, but scuffles broke out when police started clearing streets after nightfall. Some protesters retreated into a shopping complex where they and police hit each other with clubs and umbrellas.Police appeared to arrest some people, but reporters couldn't see how many. The violence wound down toward midnight as the remaining protesters left the area.The demonstration added to an outpouring of grievances this year against the former British colony's leaders. Critics complain they are eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy and are more responsive to the Beijing government than to the territory's people. The mainland promised Hong Kong a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years after its 1997 return to China.Police on Saturday broke up a protest in a separate area of Hong Kong complaining about an influx of mainland traders.On Sunday, some protesters called for genuinely democratic voting in Hong Kong elections. A few demanded independence.Organizers said 110,000 protesters took part, while police put the number at 28,000, according to broadcaster RTHK.A government statement said the afternoon march was \"peaceful and orderly\" but that afterward some protesters \"violently assaulted police officers.\"\"Society will absolutely not tolerate such violent acts,\" the statement said.The protests began last month in opposition to a proposed extradition law but have swelled to include complaints about an influx of mainland Chinese into Hong Kong and that Chief Executive Carrie Lam's government fails to address the needs of its people.Communist authorities have tried to discredit the protesters by saying unidentified \"Western forces\" are inciting them to destabilize Hong Kong. Protesters deny foreigners have had any role in the demonstrations.On Sunday, protesters demanded an investigation into complaints that police assaulted participants in earlier demonstrations against the extradition law.Starting at about 3 p.m., they filled three streets radiating out from an intersection in Sha Tin, a crowded neighborhood of office and apartment buildings, shopping malls and hotels. Some carried signs reading \"Police Are Liars.\" Other signs read \"Defend Hong Kong.\"At about 8:30 p.m., police in green fatigues with helmets and shields cleared the streets by walking shoulder-to-shoulder toward the intersection. Some protesters threw bricks but most withdrew peacefully and watched the police.Many protesters appeared to leave the area, while others entered the shopping-and-apartment complex at the intersection. Reporters couldn't see how many protesters still were in the area.Inside the complex, protesters threw umbrellas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a symbol of the protests \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and water bottles.The violence wound down as most of the remaining protesters fled to an adjacent subway station and left aboard crowded trains.Some protesters on Sunday carried American, British or colonial-era Hong Kong flags.\"I think there is now a huge problem on how the police enforce the law,\" said Nelson Yip, a protester in his 40s.Lam's government suspended action last month on the extradition bill. It would have allowed Hong Kong crime suspects to be transferred to the mainland, where the ruling Communist Party controls the court system.Lam apologized for her handling of the legislation, but critics are demanding she resign.\"Carrie Lam has been hiding,\" said Yip. \"She has made many promises but she has not been able to fulfill them. There is no sign she is going to fulfill them.\"On Saturday, police used clubs and tear gas to break up a crowd of mostly young protesters who called for tighter control on mainland traders who visit Hong Kong. Critics say they are improperly undercutting Hong Kong businesses.\"The police seem to have become even more violent,\" said Peggie Cheung, 59, who joined Sunday's protest. \"Coming out on the streets feels like a responsibility to me.\"In a separate demonstration earlier Sunday, a group representing Hong Kong journalists marched to Lam's office on Hong Kong Island to highlight complaints that police beat and obstructed reporters at earlier demonstrations.\"It seems that they have deliberately targeted the journalists,\" said Chris Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association.Police issued a statement promising better training for officers and communication with reporters.\"There is room for improvement,\" the statement said.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam this week said the bill was \"dead\" after having suspended it last month, but opponents vow to settle for nothing short of its formal withdrawal.Most protests centered on the central business district, but demonstrators have recently begun to look elsewhere to widen support by taking up narrower, more domestic issues.\"Our lovely town has become chaos,\" said Ryan Lai, 50, a resident of Sheung Shui, where so-called \"parallel traders\" buy bulk quantities of duty-free goods to be carried into mainland China and sold.\"We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to stop travel and buying, but please, just make it orderly and legal,\" he added. \"The extradition bill was the tipping point for us to come out. We want Sheung Shui back.\"Mainland traders have long been a source of anger among those in Hong Kong who say they have fueled inflation, driven up property prices, dodged taxes and diluted the town's identity.Hundreds of police patrolled nearby streets as protesters chanted demands in Mandarin, China's official language, for the traders to go home. Many street-level shops were shuttered ahead of the march.\"We want to raise awareness in Washington that the United States has to do more now to help Hong Kong become fully democratic,\" said a resident of the nearby town of Fanling, who was one of five people in the crowd carrying U.S. flags.\"They are the most important power left that can stand up to China,\" added the 30-year-old man, who gave his name only as David, declining to reveal his surname.Hong Kong's lack of full democracy was behind the recent unrest, said Jimmy Sham, of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized protests against the extradition bill.\"The government, Carrie Lam, some legislators in functional constituencies are not elected by the people, so there are many escalating actions in different districts to reflect different social issues,\" he said.\"If political problems are not solved, social well-being issues will continue to emerge endlessly.\"Similar protests have included a march last week by nearly 2,000 people in the Tuen Mun residential district to protest against what they saw as the nuisance of brash singing and dancing to Mandarin pop songs by middle-aged mainland women.On Sunday, tens of thousands marched in one of Kowloon's most popular tourist shopping areas, trying to persuade mainland Chinese tourists to back opposition to the extradition bill.When former colonial ruler Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Chinese Communist leaders promised the city a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.But many say China has progressively tightened its grip, putting Hong Kong's freedoms under threat through a range of measures such as the extradition bill.Anti-extradition protesters plan another demonstration on Sunday in the town of Sha Tin, in the so-called New Territories between Hong Kong island and the border with China.", "Hong Kong protests augur murky outlook for financial hub,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,13,2019": "HONG KONG--It's still the world's \"freest\" economy, one of the biggest global financial centers and a scenic haven for tycoons and tourists, but the waves of protests rocking Hong Kong are exposing strains unlikely to dissipate as communist-ruled Beijing's influence grows.The end of the former British colony's 50-year grace period after China took control in 1997 is years away, and the protests have made only a minor dent in day-to-day business. But they point to issues clouding the outlook, as investors and residents fret that the city will lose its Western-style freedoms.Many in Hong Kong believe their future hinges on keeping the civil liberties, independent courts and other advantages Beijing promised to preserve for at least a half-century after Britain ceded control under an arrangement dubbed \"one-country, two systems.\"\"We're still talking about 28 years,\" says Grant Strudwick, vice president for Asia for Pinkerton, which provides risk management services. \"The spotlight is on China as to how they treat this transition period.\"Hong Kong's economy once was about a fifth the size of China's. Now, it's a tiny fraction of that, thanks in no small part to an industrial boom driven by Hong Kong tycoons who set up factories across the border after China opened to outside investment in the 1970s.The territory's success as a center for trade and investment is grounded in its independent legal system and the free flow of information, said Joseph Cheng, a political analyst and leader of a pro-democracy coalition, the Alliance for True Democracy.\"These are two important assets enabling Hong Kong to have a distinct edge over major coastal cities in China, like Shanghai, like Shenzhen,\" he said.He believes that, without further moves toward democracy, Hong Kong will likely become more unstable.Confidence in the \"one country, two systems\" experiment was already feeble when the top local leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, put forward legislation that would allow authorities to send suspects held in Hong Kong to face trial in mainland Chinese courts that provide no assurances of independent judges, due process and other Western legal protections.As tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents took to the streets in protests and business groups and foreign governments registered their concerns, Lam suspended the proposed legislation. Pro-democracy activists have pressed on with the protests, demanding she permanently withdraw the bill, order an independent inquiry into heavy-handed police tactics and resign.On Tuesday, Lam insisted that the extradition bill was \"dead.\" Hong Kong's government also issued a statement saying it doesn't plan to implement the \"social credit\" system used in the mainland to penalize and reward behavior measured using various technologies including data processing and facial recognition that critics have described as Orwellian.Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, though some have turned violent. Protesters vandalized the local legislative building earlier this month. Such sights might deter some investors, but they also show the city is a world apart from the rest of China, where public dissent is banned.The protests are \"part of the checks and balances in place in Hong Kong that support institutional strength,\" the ratings agency Moody's said in a recent update.The conservative think tank Heritage Foundation has ranked Hong Kong the \"freest economy\" for 25 straight years. The city is the No. 3 financial center, according to an international survey of bankers, behind New York and London. It plays a pivotal role in financing for China and was the top location for initial public offerings in 2018, with nearly $37 billion raised.As small as it is relative to China as a whole, Hong Kong retains an outsized strategic role for Beijing, says Ken Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings.If trade tensions between the U.S. and China worsen further, leading Washington to curb financial activities of mainland companies in American markets, Hong Kong's role for launching IPOs could grow further, he notes.For now, it's Hong Kong's proximity to China, and its special status, that make it such an important location for businesses, analysts say.Strudwick said Beijing's efforts to build a \"Greater Bay area\" encompassing Hong Kong and other parts of the manufacturing-heavy Pearl River Delta are helping to integrate the territory more closely with neighbors such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen. That might help revitalize its economy, which expanded at an anemic 0.6% annual rate in the last quarter, battered by slowing demand and trade tensions.While unemployment is low, bread-and-butter issues such as how to afford to live in a city with the world's priciest real estate are adding to frustrations.Salaries come nowhere close to matching the territory's per capita GDP of nearly $50,000 a year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a reflection of the vast disparities in wealth between those living in villas on Victoria Peak and the majority occupying tiny apartments that sell for about $24,000 per square meter.\"Everything has changed. I am not talking about democracy, it seems no matter how hard you work, your life remains hard. In the past, you could afford an apartment if you worked hard,\" said a laundry shop worker who like many protest supporters gave only her first name, Lisa. \"This is a huge difference.\"For a country like China whose leaders often boast of a 3,000-plus year history, 50 years is only a snippet of time. For Hong Kong residents taking to the streets in protest, it's the better part of a lifetime.\"It's how the social strata and those freedoms are managed that is going to be the focus of future potential protest activity and unrest and uncertainty,\" Strudwick said. \"It's still going to be a major global city into the future. It's a case of understanding the risks and knowing what you're getting into come that 2047 time frame.\"", "Taiwan defends U.S. arms deal after China sanctions threat,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,13,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan on Saturday defended a proposal to purchase $2.2 billion in arms from the U.S., following a Chinese announcement that it would sanction any American companies involved in the deal.U.S. weapons help strengthen Taiwan's self-defense in the face of a growing military threat from China, the defense ministry said.\"The national army will continue to strengthen its key defense forces, ensure national security, protect its homeland and ensure that the fruits of freedom and democracy won't be attacked,\" the ministry said in a statement.China announced late Friday that it would impose sanctions on any U.S. enterprises involved in the deal, saying it \"undermines China's sovereignty and national security.\"Taiwan split from China during a civil war in 1949, but the mainland still considers the self-governing island as part of its territory.The U.S., which recognized Beijing as the government of China in 1979, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but U.S. law requires that it provide Taiwan with sufficient defense equipment and services for self-defense.The Trump administration announced the proposed $2.2 billion sale, which would include 108 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger surface-to-air missiles, earlier in the week.Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, speaking in New York on Friday, said that her government has strengthened Taiwan's national defense to protect its democracy, according to a transcript posted on the presidential office website.China has objected to her U.S. visit, which Taiwan calls a \"two-evening transit stop\" on the way to Haiti and three other Caribbean nations that recognize Taiwan.\"We urge the U.S. to abide by the 'One China' principle and ... not allow Tsai Ing-wen's stopover, cease official exchanges with Taiwan and refrain from providing any platform for separatist Taiwan independence forces,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday in Beiijng.Tsai dismissed Chinese criticism of both her visit and the arms deal. \"We don't need our neighbor to make irresponsible remarks,\" she told reporters in New York, according to Taiwan's official Central News Agency.She has rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the \"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong.

Wang Zhimin dismissed calls to exonerate protesters who have been arrested, saying it would be \"a blatant challenge to the rule of law in Hong Kong.\"\"Regarding the recent series of violent incidents, all Hong Kong people, including those present, have expressed condemnation,\" he said in a speech to Beijing loyalists in Hong Kong.Pro-democracy activists placed sunflowers and sang hymns at the memorial for Leung.

Yuen urged Hong Kong people to \"be courageous and be persistent\" in carrying out their peaceful struggle so that Leung didn't die in vain. Apart from Leung, three other young people have reportedly died, including a woman who left a suicide message.\"Mr. Leung's death brought us pain, but this is the way he has spoken out against the authorities. He has already finished what he should do. Today, Hong Kong people still need to speak up, and they need to speak up with an even louder and stronger voice,\" Yuen said.The protests against the proposed extradition legislation have given voice to fears that Hong Kong is losing the freedoms guaranteed to it when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. Critics fear suspects would face unfair and politicized trials in mainland China, and that critics of the ruling Communist Party would be targeted.Billy Li, a lawyer who stopped by the memorial after attending court, said he shared the frustration of the protesters.\"Even when you see the young people break into the legislative building to air their anger, to some extent I can understand their desperation.

In previous years, the area has been a battleground for Hong Kong people angry over the flood of Chinese day-trippers.Another protest on Sunday will take place in the suburban district of Sha Tin, which has also been the site of clashes between Hong Kong residents and mainland visitors.The protesters are expected to use similar tactics to those of a rally at a tourist area on Sunday, where they handed out pamphlets printed in the simplified Chinese characters used on the mainland. They also shouted slogans in Mandarin, China's most common dialect.\"They hope they can make an influence, which the Chinese government is obviously very afraid of,\" said a 22-year-old student from Hong Kong who runs an Instagram page called AntiELAB that aims to raise awareness about the protests and political situation in Hong Kong. Instagram is blocked in mainland China.\"It's evolving every day and that's how it should be,\" said the Britain-based student, referring to the movement where, he says, \"everyone is their own leader.\"Under the terms of the handover from Britain in 1997, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.But for many Hong Kong residents, the extradition bill is the latest step in a relentless march towards mainland control.The protesters' tactics have evolved significantly since the \"Umbrella\" movement demonstrations in late 2014, which paralyzed parts of the former British colony for 79 days but did not win concessions from Beijing on greater democracy.That failure, coupled with prosecutions of at least 100 protesters, mostly youths, had until last month discouraged many young people from going back to the streets.Activists are mobilizing supporters through a host of Internet forums and messaging app groups, taking out ads in international newspapers and petitioning diplomats to raise awareness among world leaders. All of it is meant to complicate Beijing's diplomatic agenda.Denise Ho, a Hong Kong singer and activist banned in mainland China, urged international action in an address on Monday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. Beijing's delegation twice interrupted her speech with points of order.\"I think this is really something that we haven't seen before. It is a new age of protest,\" said Labor Party lawmaker Fernando Cheung, who along with others is on a hunger strike over the extradition bill.\"The mainland population has to come to accept Hong Kong as having a different system. Without that understanding and consent, the conflict between the two populations would come about eventually and then the two systems cannot be protected.\"People rallied in cities across the world in June, including London, New York, Toronto and Melbourne, coinciding with demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled city that organizers said drew around a million people.The demonstrators are also erecting \"Lennon Walls\" across Hong Kong, including in rural and pro-Beijing districts, with supporters pasting colorful protest memos along pedestrian underpasses, footbridges, tunnels and near temples.One message on many walls reads: \"Fight Together.\"Many of the students were babies or toddlers when Britain returned Hong Kong to China. But they have adopted the colonial flag as a symbol of protest and even draped it over the speaker's lectern in the legislature when they stormed it hours after city leaders toasted the 22nd anniversary of the handover.China has condemned the protests in Hong Kong as an \"undisguised challenge\" to the formula under which the city is ruled, although some observers say the protesters still have some way to go before they cross Chinese leader Xi Jinping's \"red line\" of undermining Chinese sovereignty.\"As long as they don't strive for independence of Hong Kong with a large number of people, and push mainlanders to revolt against the Chinese Communist Party, I believe the red line is still quite far away,\" said Ming Sing, an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largesse in Tonga threatens future of Pacific nation,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,11,2019": "NUKU'ALOFA, Tonga--The days unfold at a leisurely pace in Tonga, a South Pacific archipelago with no traffic lights or fast-food chains. Snuffling pigs roam dusty roads that wind through villages dotted with churches.Yet even in this far-flung island kingdom there are signs that a battle for power and influence is heating up among much larger nations--and Tonga may end up paying the price.In the capital, Nuku'alofa, government officials work in a shiny new office block--an $11 million (1.2 billion yen) gift from China that is rivaled in grandeur only by China's imposing new embassy complex.Dozens of Tongan bureaucrats take all-expenses-paid training trips to Beijing each year, and China has laid out millions of dollars to bring 107 Tongan athletes and coaches to a training camp in China's Sichuan province ahead of this month's Pacific Games in Samoa.\"The best facilities. The gym, the track, and a lot of equipment we don't have here in Tonga,\" said Tevita Fauonuku, the country's head athletic coach. \"The accommodation: lovely, beautiful. And the meals. Not only that, but China gave each and everyone some money. A per diem.\"China also offered low-interest loans after pro-democracy rioters destroyed much of downtown Nuku'alofa in 2006, and analysts say those loans could prove Tonga's undoing. The country of 106,000 people owes some $108 million to China's Export-Import bank, equivalent to about 25 percent of GDP.The U.S. ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse Jr., calls China's lending in the Pacific \"payday loan diplomacy.\"\"The money looks attractive and easy upfront, but you better read the fine print,\" he said.China's ambassador to Tonga, Wang Baodong, said China was the only country willing to step up to help Tonga during its time of need.Graeme Smith, a specialist in Chinese investment in the Pacific, is not convinced China tried to trap Tonga in debt, saying its own financial mismanagement is as much to blame.Nonetheless, he said it's worrying that the nation of 171 islands, already vulnerable to costly natural disasters, has little ability to repay.***Why is China pouring money into Tonga?Teisina Fuko, a 69-year-old former parliament member, suspects China finds his country's location useful.\"I think Tonga is maybe a window to the Western side,\" he said. \"Because it's easy to get here and look into New Zealand, Australia.\"\"It's a steppingstone,\" he said.For decades, the South Pacific was considered the somewhat sleepy backyard of Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Now, as China exerts increasing influence, Western allies are responding.Experts say there hasn't been this level of geopolitical competition in the region since the United States and Japan were bombing each other's occupied atolls.\"We haven't seen anything like this since World War II,\" said Smith, a research fellow at Australian National University.After Cyclone Gita destroyed Tonga's historic Parliament House last year, the government first suggested China might like to pay to rebuild it. Then Australia and New Zealand stepped in and are now considering jointly funding the project.Elsewhere in the region, Australia is redeveloping a Papua New Guinea naval base while New Zealand has announced it will spend an extra $500 million on overseas aid over four years, with most of it directed at South Pacific nations.Rory Medcalf, the head of the National Security College at Australian National University, said the area could provide a security bridgehead for China's navy, which currently must sail through the U.S.-friendly islands of Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines to get to the Pacific.Other possible explanations, Medcalf said, include the region's fisheries, seabed minerals and other natural resources, as well as China's ongoing effort to lure away the few remaining countries that recognize Taiwan instead of China--several of them Pacific island nations.\"It's not entirely clear what China wants in the South Pacific,\" Medcalf said. \"It's just clear that China is becoming very active and making its presence felt.\"China has poured about $1.5 billion in aid and low-interest loans into the South Pacific since 2011, putting it behind only Australia, according to an analysis by Australian think-tank the Lowy Institute. And that figure rises to over $6 billion when future commitments are included.China's use of loans and aid to gain influence in developing nations worldwide is nothing new, as illustrated by Chinese-financed projects from Africa to Latin America and the Asian subcontinent.Some worry that these can become debt traps when nations can't repay. In Sri Lanka, for example, the government was forced to hand over control of its Hambantota port as it struggles to repay loans it got from China to build the facility--a move that has given Beijing a strategic foothold within hundreds of miles of rival India.Wang said China has only benevolent intentions in Tonga and no hidden agenda. \"Some people in the West are being over-sensitive and too suspicious,\" he said. \"No need.\"***It's not just money flowing in from China. Chinese immigrants began arriving in the 1990s when Tonga started selling passports.The passports, which went for about $10,000 each, were aimed at attracting wealthy Hong Kong residents hedging their bets ahead of the former British colony's return to China in 1997. Instead, they were snapped up by rural Chinese looking for a better life--and who now compete with native Tongans for scarce jobs.Chinese immigrants already run most of the dozens of hole-in-the-wall groceries dotting the islands, selling cheap imports like potato chips and canned meat. And Tongans worry they are now expanding into farming and construction.Most Tongans live a subsistence existence in a nation where the king is revered and people take Christianity so seriously that working on Sundays is, with few exceptions, banned under the Constitution. The economy relies on foreign aid and cash sent home by Tongans working abroad.And the Chinese loans haven't changed that because the money went to Chinese-run projects, Fuko said.\"They brought the money, they brought the workers, they brought the building materials,\" he said. \"Maybe a few Tongans pulled wheelbarrows.\"Wang acknowledged the criticism that Chinese immigrants run many businesses but said Tonga's leaders recognize the contribution they make and have even called on Tongans to learn from their hard-work ethic.Tonga never benefited from the passport money, either. A former financial adviser to the government, American Jesse Bogdonoff, helped place about $26 million into speculative investments and almost all of it evaporated.***The real threat to Tonga's future may lie in its crippling loans from China.In December 2017, the International Monetary Fund increased Tonga's debt distress rating from moderate to high risk, citing its vulnerability to natural disasters and noting that the large upcoming loan repayments to China would reduce Tonga's foreign exchange reserves, double its debt-servicing costs, and could force the country to borrow yet more money.Repayments were due to start last year, and panic crept in.In August, Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pohiva called on other Pacific nations to join forces to demand debt relief, warning that China could snatch away buildings and other assets. But he reversed his position days later, saying Tonga was \"exceedingly grateful\" for China's help.Within months Tonga announced it had been given a reprieve and didn't need to start repayments for another five years.Tonga also said it was joining China's Belt and Road Initiative, the trillion-dollar global investment and lending program that is a signature policy of President Xi Jinping.Tongan officials don't seem eager to discuss the relationship with China. The prime minister withdrew from an interview with The Associated Press because of an illness, while Finance Minister Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa canceled at the last minute due to \"something urgent.\" The chief secretary to the prime minister's office, Edgar Cocker, agreed to meet but then quickly asked a reporter to leave, saying he wasn't authorized to speak for the government.Cocker said all questions about China's loans and aid should be directed to Chinese officials.Wang said there was no link between Tonga getting a break on its loans and joining the Belt and Road Initiative. He said Tonga had raised concerns about the loan, and China was willing to help.Tonga's immediate financial crisis has been averted, but Fuko thinks the loans have given China the upper hand.\"I don't know how we are going to pay that back,\" the former lawmaker said.***An unintended consequence of Tonga's China loans could be a reduction in foreign investment and withering of the revenues needed to pay them back.Take the Scenic Hotel. One of the few large hotels on the main island of Tongatapu, it abruptly closed its doors in March in a setback to the key tourism industry.Brendan Taylor, managing director of the New Zealand-based Scenic Hotel Group, said one problem was the new Foreign Exchange Control Act Tonga introduced last year.Designed to keep money in the country and protect its currency during financial emergencies, it was enacted as Tonga prepared to begin making the Chinese loan repayments.\"The issue you have got in Tonga is that no overseas companies are keen to go in,\" Taylor said. \"They've cut out investors.\"He said the hotel got a large insurance payout after it was hit by Cyclone Gita. But the new law created legal hurdles to move money out of Tonga to pay New Zealand suppliers for repairs and so the payout languished in a Tongan trust account, he said.Tonga-based lawyer Ralph Stephenson said that while the law isn't being enforced, it's still spooking investors.\"The penalties for breaching the act are draconian, in terms of fines that can be imposed, and also in so far as the act actually affords the courts the power to forfeit property,\" he said.***Wang said any suggestion that China might be engaged in a Pacific power struggle with the West or using Tonga to keep tabs or even spy on New Zealand and Australia is nonsense.\"Tonga is a small country. It's almost impossible to hide any secret,\" Wang said. \"For some of our Western friends, personally, I think they should be confident in their relations and influence in this region.\"If China sees any strategic importance to Tonga, it was the country's recognition that Taiwan is part of China, he said. Tonga switched from recognizing Taiwan and established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1998.China's economic success has allowed it to build new embassies around the world and too much shouldn't be read into the size of its new embassy in Tonga, Wang said.He said that over the past 20 years, diplomatic relations between China and Tonga have widened to include infrastructure, trade, education and sports. He doesn't see it as a case of larger countries jockeying for influence.\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"Just whoever is able to provide assistance for the goodness of the Tongan people.\"But for Ola Koloi, who runs a tourist lodge, China's footprint is too pervasive, influencing what she can buy since so many goods for sale come from China.She said the China loans should worry every Tongan.\"I feel like I'll be Chinese soon,\" she said.", "Man suspected of running pirated manga website held in Manila,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,July,10,2019": "Philippine immigration authorities have detained the suspected operator of a pirated manga website that is believed to have caused billions of dollars in damage to the Japanese comic industry.Romi Hoshino, 27, was taken into custody at an international airport in Manila on July 7, the authorities said July 9.An immigration official said Hoshino was nabbed outside a departure terminal before he could board a flight to Hong Kong.The Japanese government, through its embassy in Manila, has asked the Philippines for cooperation in the investigation into Hoshino, who is suspected of violating the Copyright Law.He is believed to be the main operator of the Mangamura (Manga village) website, which allowed users to read illegally copied manga for free.Fukuoka and other prefectural police plan to arrest Hoshino after he is sent to Japan. Police suspect others were also involved in the operation of the website.The Mangamura site had long been a thorn in the side of Japanese publishers and groups representing comic artists. It carried popular Japanese manga without obtaining permission from the artists from January 2016 to April 2018, when it was shut down, according to Japanese government sources.The estimated financial damage caused by Mangamura to the Japanese manga industry was about 320 billion yen ($3 billion), according to the Tokyo-based Content Overseas Distribution Association.Entrusted by comic artists, major publisher Kodansha Ltd., also based in Tokyo, has filed criminal complaints with the Fukuoka and other prefectural police over suspected copyright infringements by Mangamura and its operators.The artists include Hajime Isayama, author of popular manga \u00e2\u0080\u009cAttack on Titan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was published by Kodansha.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect the entire picture of this case will be clarified,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kodansha said in a statement issued on July 9.(This article was compiled from reports by Akiko Suzuki and Amane Shimazaki.)", "Indonesia returns 57 containers of developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waste,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,10,2019": "JAKARTA--Indonesia is sending dozens of containers of waste back to wealthy nations after finding it was contaminated with used diapers, plastic and other materials, adding to a growing backlash in Southeast Asia against being a dumping ground for the developed world's rubbish.The Directorate General of Customs said Tuesday that 49 containers at Batam port near Singapore will be returned to Australia, the United States, France, Germany and Hong Kong after inspections showed their contents violated Indonesian laws on the import of hazardous and toxic waste.Separately, the head of customs at East Java's Tanjung Perak port, Basuki Suryanto, said eight other containers with 210 tons of waste that arrived from Australia on June 20 were supposed to contain only paper but included other matter.\"It turned out those containers also had household waste, used cans, plastic bottles, used oil packaging, used electronics, used baby diapers and used footwear. So we decided to return it to the country of origin,\" he said.China banned the import of plastic waste at the end of 2017, resulting in more being sent to developing Southeast Asian nations.A study published in June last year in the journal Science Advances that used United Nations data found other nations would need to find a home for more than 110 million tons of plastic waste by 2030 because of the Chinese ban. Indonesia and China are themselves among the world's biggest producers of plastic waste, which is increasingly fouling their own land, seas and beaches.Suryanto said the Indonesian-owned company that imported the Australian waste to the East Java port is obliged to return it to Australia within 90 days. No other sanctions were planned, he said.Directorate General of Customs spokesman Deni Surjantiro said the 49 containers to be repatriated from Batam were among 65 containers of waste inspected at the port. Eleven were filled with plastic trash and 38 contaminated by toxic or otherwise hazardous waste, he said.Importing hazardous waste into Indonesia is a criminal offense, Surjantiro said, with a maximum 12-year prison sentence and a maximum fine of 12 billion rupiah ($850,000 or 93 million yen).The Philippines was recently involved in a high-profile spat with Canada over what Philippine officials said was illegally transported garbage and in May sent 69 containers back to Canada. Malaysia in May said it would send back some 3,000 tons of non-recyclable plastic waste to countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.Philippine officials said the Canadian garbage was transported to their country in 103 containers in 2013 and 2014 and falsely declared as recyclable plastic scraps. Some of the garbage was disposed of, leaving 69 containers of electrical and household waste, including used diapers, rotting in two Philippine ports.", "Hong Kong protesters to continue after bill declared \u00e2\u0080\u0098dead\u00e2\u0080\u0099,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,10,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong protest leaders opposed to the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday that they will continue their demonstrations, even after Lam declared the effort to amend a highly contentious extradition bill \"dead.\"Protesters are persisting in their demands for the bill to be formally withdrawn and an investigation opened into heavy-handed tactics used by police against demonstrators.

Critics fear suspects would face unfair and politicized trials, and that opponents of China's ruling Communist Party would be targeted.In the most recent protest on Sunday, tens of thousands of people, chanting \"Free Hong Kong\" and some carrying British colonial-era flags, marched toward a high-speed railway station that connects Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. They said they wanted to carry their protest message to those on the mainland, where state-run media have not covered the protests widely but have focused instead on clashes with police and property damage.On July 1, the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain back to China, a peaceful march drew hundreds of thousands of people but was overshadowed by an assault on the territory's legislative building.

She is playing word games,\" said Chan Wai Lam William, general officer of the Student Union of Chinese University of Hong Kong.Demonstrators have called for Lam to resign as Hong Kong chief executive, for an independent investigation into police actions against protesters, and for the government to abandon the description of a violent protest on June 12 as a riot.\"It is not a simple thing for CE (chief executive) to step down, and I myself still have the passion and undertaking to service Hong Kong people,\" Lam said when asked about the protesters' demands.\"I hope that Hong Kong society can give me and my team the opportunity and room to allow us to use our new governance style to response to people's demand in economy and in livelihood.\"Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy, but in recent years there has been growing concern about the erosion of those freedoms at the hands of Beijing.Critics of the extradition bill fear Beijing could use it to crack down on dissent.China has called the protests an \"undisguised challenge\" to the \"one country, two systems\" model under which Hong Kong is ruled that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who has been aligned with the protesters, said Lam's response was insufficient.\"She still doesn't get it. If she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t establish an independent inquiry commission, it's the death of her administration, not just the bill.

Just like them, she seems to have gotten under Beijing's skin--this time at an international human rights venue.The Cantopop singer used her star power to stand up to China's economic and political power at the U.N.'s top human rights body Monday, telling the Human Rights Council that human rights were under attack in Hong Kong and asking whether it would suspend China as a member of the 47-nation body for its abuses.Ever sensitive to its growing international reputation, China shot back and interrupted Ho twice during her allotted 90-second slot. The chair, Iceland's ambassador in Geneva Harald Aspelund, gave some gentle reminders, but let her keep talking.Ho's comments were some of the sharpest and most varied criticism of China that the council has heard since the United States pulled out last year, partly over Trump administration complaints that too many rights-violating states were among its members. The United States had been generally seen as one of the countries least hesitant to stand up to its rising rival at the Geneva-based council.Ho ripped into the bill that would allow Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China for trial, saying such a move would \"remove the firewall protecting Hong Kong from interference of the Chinese government\"--an allusion to a British-China agreement linked to Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997.Chinese diplomat Dai Demao quickly upbraided her, saying she had wrongly referred to Hong Kong \"side-by-side\" with China. He said that was an affront to the widely recognized \"One China\" policy.Ho then denounced the disqualifications of lawmakers, the jailing of activists and the \"cross-border kidnappings\" of booksellers in Hong Kong as signs of \"China's tightening grip.\" She said Hong Kong autonomy had slowly eroded since the handover. She accused China of \"preventing our democracy at all costs\" such as by appointing as Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam, who the protesters want to see ousted.Dai burst in again to reject \"unfounded allegations\" and appealed to the chair that she refrain from using \"abusive language.\"Unbowed, Ho raised the tone again, asking the council whether it would suspend China and convene an urgent session to protect people in Hong Kong amid rising protests.UN Watch, the advocacy group that hosted Ho, faulted Western countries for not speaking out in her defense. China's envoy also blasted the nongovernmental organization, saying it had \"abused its consultative status\" and engaged in slandering--without mentioning the group or Ho by name.Speaking to reporters afterward, Ho said she hadn't received any threats for her outspokenness.\"I don't know if it will stay this way,\" she said. \"I will stand strong.\"In an interview with The Associated Press before the session, Ho said the implications of China's alleged rights abuses went far beyond Hong Kong, in places like Tibet and China's Xinjiang region, home to many Uighur Muslims.\"This is a very serious issue and a global issue, that not only touches Hong Kong people, but really the global world--where you see governments they are silencing themselves, because of being afraid of political reprisal, economic reprisal,\" she said.Ho praised a \"creative move\" by protesters in Kowloon over the weekend who reached out to incoming tourists from mainland China, saying many people in China had been \"brainwashed to think that Hong Kong people are just rioters and anti-China, which is not true.\"Ho said her activism has come at a price: She hasn't had any commercial work for the last several years, and she can't travel to China. But she brushed off the personal impact, and said she'll stay committed to the cause--even though she can't predict how things will evolve.\"The police they are still using excessive force,\" she said. \"As long as the Hong Kong government keeps on ignoring everything that's happening and just pretending that it's OK, these protests will go on--I'm quite sure of that.\"", "Tens of thousands in Hong Kong take message to mainlanders,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,8,2019": "HONG KONG--Tens of thousands of people, many wearing black shirts and some carrying British colonial-era flags, marched in Hong Kong on Sunday, targeting a mainland Chinese audience as a month-old protest movement showed no signs of abating.Chanting \"Free Hong Kong\" and words of encouragement to their fellow citizens, wave after wave of demonstrators streamed by a shopping district popular with mainland visitors on a march to the high-speed railway station that connects the semi-autonomous Chinese territory to Guangdong and other mainland cities.Hong Kong has been riven by huge marches and sometimes disruptive protests for the past month, sparked by proposed changes to extradition laws that would have allowed suspects to be sent to the mainland to face trial. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam suspended the bill and apologized for how it was handled, but protesters want it to be formally withdrawn and for Lam to resign.Organizers said 230,000 people marched on Sunday, while police estimated the crowd at 56,000.\"We want to show our peaceful, graceful protest to the mainland visitors because the information is rather blocked in mainland,\" march organizer Ventus Lau said. \"We want to show them the true image and the message of Hong Kongers.\"Chinese media have not covered the protests or their origins widely, focusing on clashes with police and damage to public property.As the crowd broke up Sunday night, a few hundred remained and taunted police who had retreated behind huge barriers set up outside the railway station, while others moved to Canton Road, a street lined with luxury boutique stores. Around 11 p.m., police moved to disperse protesters who were blocking a road and arrested five people for assaulting or obstructing police officers, their statement said.The march was the first major action since two simultaneous protests last Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the July 1, 1997, return of Hong Kong from Britain to China.The march through central Hong Kong that's held annually drew hundreds of thousands of people. It was overshadowed this year, however, by an assault on the legislative building by a few hundred demonstrators who shattered thick glass panels to enter the building and then wreaked havoc for three hours, spray-painting slogans on the chamber walls, overturning furniture and damaging electronic voting and fire prevention systems.Sunday's march was the first protest against the extradition legislation to take place on the Kowloon side of Hong Kongharbor. The previous ones were on Hong Kong Island, the city's business and government center.Many of the marchers were young and wore black shirts that have become the uniform of the protesters. The largely peaceful crowd also included older people carrying handheld fans in the muggy heat, as well as parents with children, including some in baby strollers.Many held placards, including one that read \"Extradite to China, disappear forever.\" Some carried the British flag or the old Hong Kong flag from when it was a British colony.\"This is our fourth march because we think this government is not taking care of Hong Kong,\" said Dan Lee, who joined with his wife and their three children. \"We need to save Hong Kong and we need to come out for our future generations.\"The extradition legislation has raised concerns about an erosion of freedoms and rights in Hong Kong, which was guaranteed its own legal system for 50 years after its return to China in 1997.Prior to the march, police put up large barricades blocking a main entrance to the railway station to prevent any attempt to enter it. Only passengers with train reservations were allowed into the station, the mass transit authority said, and Hong Kong media reported that ticket sales had been suspended for afternoon trains.\"The high-speed railway station is a connection between Hong Kong and China and this is the nearest place we can spread our message to China,\" said Lau, the march organizer.The station was a source of contention before it opened last September, because passengers pass through Chinese immigration and customs inside. Some opposition lawmakers said the fact that Chinese law applies in the immigration area violates the handover agreement under which Hong Kong maintains its own legal system.Protesters also are demanding an independent investigation into a crackdown on June 12 demonstrations in which officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds blocking major streets. Police said the tactics, harsher than usual for Hong Kong, were justified after some protesters turned violent. Dozens were injured, both protesters and police.The protesters are also calling for the direct election of Hong Kong's leader. Lam was chosen by an elite committee of mainly pro-Beijing electors.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s envoy to Britain laments \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cold War mentality\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over Hong Kong protests,REUTERS,July,8,2019": "LONDON--China is not interested in a diplomatic war with Britain but rejects the \"Cold War mentality\" it has seen from some British politicians over Hong Kong, China's ambassador to London said on Sunday.China and Britain have engaged in a public spat over mass protests in Hong Kong against a now suspended bill that would allow extradition to mainland China.Asked whether Beijing would intervene directly, ambassador Liu Xiaoming Liu told BBC TV that China was fully committed to the \"one country, two systems\" agreement and that he had full confidence in Hong Kong's ability to resolve the situation.He said it was the British government that was interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and trying to \"obstruct the legal process.\"Liu was summoned to the British foreign office earlier this week following his comments that \"colonial\" Britain should keep its \"hands off Hong Kong.\" Hong Kong was under British rule for almost 150 years until 1997.\"We are not interested in diplomatic war with the UK, ... we are still committed to this golden era between our two countries,\" he said on Sunday, but added that the language used by some British politicians was \"Cold War mentality language.\"In her first few months in office in 2016 Prime Minister Theresa May hailed \"a golden era\" of Sino-British relations, a phrase both countries have continued to use since.But Britain's relations with China under May, who is due to step down later this month, have also been complicated by a disagreement with Washington over whether to ban China's Huawei from 5G telecommunications networks as a security risk.Liu said he could promise \"100 percent\" that Huawei would not pass information back to the government in Beijing.\"Huawei is a good company, it is a leader of 5G. I think it you reject Huawei you will miss enormous opportunities. I think they are here for win-win cooperation they are not here to spy on people,\" he said.Hundreds of protesters in the former British colony besieged and broke into the legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of return to Chinese rule.Critics say the extradition bill would undermine Hong Kong's much-cherished independent judiciary and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party.Liu told the BBC that Hong Kong had received no instructions or orders from Beijing to introduce the bill.

Police said on Sunday some roads would be closed temporarily and public transport would be diverted.Hong Kong's Tourism Association has also said some travel agencies would stay away from the fashionable Tsim Sha Tsui area, popular with mainland visitors, on Sunday.Organizers have produced witty advertisements to urge people to join the march. \"Dear magicians, if you were unable to turn the cold-hearted into warm-hearted, take to the streets with us on July 7,\" said one.The extradition bill, which has left Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam clinging to her job, would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city.Lawyers and rights groups say China's justice system is marked by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention, claims that Beijing denies.

For that reason, it is available only on weekends and national holidays between mid-March and June, while it runs every day in May.In October and November, passengers can ride the bus every day except when it is sidelined for maintenance.The bus tour includes visits to the renowned Kazurabashi rope bridge and a peeing boy statue set up over the gorge floor, a boat trip at the Obokekyo valley that is home to magnificent eroded rocks, and other local attractions.The gorge is also the place where defeated warriors of the Taira clan are said to have lived in secrecy.But many sightseers join the tour because they want to ride the nostalgic bus \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat perfectly matches the landscape in the off-the-beaten-track area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a Shikoku Kotsu official.Foreign tourists mainly from other Asian countries accounted for about 40 percent of tour participants last year.

Hours later, protesters swarmed into the legislature, leaving a trail of destruction before riot police ordered them out three hours later.\"After the incident, I have strong reason to believe that the central government together with the Hong Kong government will try their very best to tighten their control in Hong Kong and try to undermine the 'one country, two systems' furthermore,\" Lam said Wednesday.Many people in Hong Kong worry that China is chipping away at the freedoms and rights they were guaranteed for 50 years after the then-British colony was returned to China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework 22 years ago this week.As hundreds of thousands of people marched on Monday to voice these fears, a much smaller group of young protesters decided to break into the legislature, which was closed for a national holiday marking the anniversary of Hong Kong's July 1, 1997, handover to China.They started with a thick glass wall, hammering it over and over with a large cart.\"Please listen to me, it's very dangerous,\" Lam screamed at them, warning that they could face long prison sentences for their actions. Another lawmaker who stood between the cart and window was tackled by a protester, and later appeared dazed and slightly injured.Lam said that the young protesters, who have blocked streets, police headquarters and other government buildings in a series of protests over the past three weeks, have sacrificed enough.\"It's time for us to try our very best to convince them not to sacrifice anymore, but some of them even told us they are well prepared to die for Hong Kong,\" he said, recounting Monday's events at the site. \"It's very sad. It's very sad.\"Hong Kong police have blocked off the legislative building as a crime scene. Protesters sprayed slogans in the main chamber, tore down and bashed portraits of legislative leaders and tipped over file cabinets in offices, strewing papers on the floors. At least one elevator was heavily damaged, as were a metal curtain-wall that was forcefully pried open and glass walls that were shattered on two sides of the building.A Chinese government spokesman said that \"violent lawbreakers\" had intentionally damaged Hong Kong government facilities, calling them \"serious illegal acts that trample on the rule of law and endanger social order.\"The demonstrators had grown increasingly frustrated that, despite repeated disruptive protests, the government had not given them a response to their demands. They include the formal withdrawal of a suspended extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to China for trial, the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, the release of those arrested after a June 12 protest and an independent investigation into the unusually harsh police response on that day, which included tear gas and rubber bullets.The government says the suspension of the bill effectively killed it. Carrie Lam, who was criticized for disappearing from public view for two weeks, said Tuesday that releasing suspects without investigation would violate Hong Kong's rule of law.Lam, the pro-democracy lawmaker, said the protesters felt hopeless and powerless and wanted to make noise to show the government and the outside world that they would not give up: \"That was their choice, even if I don't agree with them, even if they understand the tactic may not work, they still wanted to try to show their anger and frustration to the government and the international community.\"", "Flag-waving Grandma Wong gives lesson in endurance,REUTERS,July,3,2019": "HONG KONG--Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have clogged the streets of Hong Kong in recent weeks, silver-haired, bespectacled \"Grandma Wong,\" usually seen waving a large British flag, stands out.Alexandra Wong, 63, who has smaller Union Jack flags pinned to her clothes and bags, has been on the front lines of mass protests in the former British colony and sometimes in tense standoffs between police and student activists.\"I bought them in Shenzhen,\" a smiling Wong, known affectionately as grandma, told Reuters of the flags, referring to the southern Chinese city across the border where she now lives.\"I had to ask secretly, because they only showed the Chinese flag. So I asked them if they had the British flag and they take it out to show me. If you don't ask, they don't show.\"Wong has joined millions in recent weeks who have taken to the streets to demonstrate against an extradition bill that would allow people in Hong Kong to be sent for trial in mainland China, where human rights are not guaranteed.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and right to protest, for at least 50 years.Grandma Wong has been one of the few demonstrators over 30 to stay sometimes into the early hours to show her support for thousands of activists, many of whom joined 79 days of \"Umbrella\" protests in 2014 pushing unsuccessfully for full democracy for one of the most densely populated cities on earth.\"I stand with Hong Kong's future. I worry about Hong Kong youth,\" she said.Some protesters have taken to waving the Union Jack during recent protests, certain to rile authorities in Beijing, and a colonial-era flag, including the Union Jack, was unfurled when protesters stormed into the legislature on Monday night.\"I miss colonial times. The British colonial time was so good for us. I saw the future,\" Wong said.Wong grew up in Sham Shui Po, one of Hong Kong's poorest areas, but was forced to flee to Shenzhen 13 years ago when she could no longer afford to live in one of the world's most expensive housing markets.\"I don't like to live there, of course. It makes me sad all the time, but I cannot live in Hong Kong,\" said Wong, whose commute back and forth for protests can sometimes take five hours and costs her more than HK$100 ($12.80 or 1,379 yen).The activist wears T-shirts in support of Hong Kong democracy when she travels into the city but changes back into plain clothes when she returns home, so as not to draw scrutiny.\"I have no kids. That's why I am not scared at all,\" she said. \"I don't have any worries about anyone. I just care about the future of Hong Kong youth.\"Britain told China to honor its commitments to protect freedoms in Hong Kong on Tuesday.

Its coverage of the protests and the publication of a harsh editorial in the official Communist Party newspaper Global Times may indicate it is prepared to take a tougher line against the demonstrators following days of forbearance.\"These violent assailants in their arrogance pay no heed to Hong Kong's law, no doubt arousing the anger and sadness of all people of the city of Hong Kong,\" the editorial said.Television images showed police moving into roads surrounding the legislative council, where protesters smashed through glass and metal barriers to occupy the space for about three hours on Monday night until police moved in shortly after midnight.Veteran opposition figure Joshua Wong acknowledged that the damage to the legislative offices has drawn criticism from some sectors in the Asian financial hub. But he said mass participation in marches and rallies over previous weeks showed there was a groundswell of support for the demonstrators' goals of demanding more accountability from the administration of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\"I understand people in Hong Kong and around the world might not 100 percent agree or disagree on all of the behavior of protesters ... but all of the requests have been ignored. So, is there any way out?\" Wong said.Lam is \"not capable as leader anymore\" and should resign, Wong said, echoing the demand of many protesters. Having been elected by a Beijing-approved committee, Lam is reliant on continuing support from Beijing, which has shown no outward signs of abandoning her so far.Wong also accused police officers of having \"double standards\" in enforcing the law, saying pro-Beijing legislators and their staff members have benefited by better treatment than their opposition counterparts throughout the weeks of protest outside the legislature.On the mainland, Beijing had sought to suppress news of the protests, which roughly coincided with celebrations of the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule. The demonstrations reflect mounting frustration with Lam and her government for not responding to demands from opposition figures that were originally sparked by a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China for trial. Lam has shelved the bills but not agreed to scrap them altogether as opponents insist she does.Hundreds of protesters swarmed into Hong Kong's legislature Monday night, defacing portraits of lawmakers and spray-painting pro-democracy slogans in the chamber before vacating it as riot police cleared surrounding streets with tear gas and then moved inside.Protesters whacked away at thick glass windows until they shattered and then pried open steel security gates. Police initially retreated as the protesters entered, avoiding a confrontation and giving them the run of the building, during which they spray painted slogans calling for a democratic election of Hong Kong's leader and denouncing the extradition legislation. Many wore yellow and white helmets, face masks and the black T-shirts that have become their uniform.The actions prompted organizers of a separate peaceful march against the extradition bill to change the endpoint of their protest from the legislature to a nearby park, after police asked them to call it off or change the route. Police wanted the march to end earlier in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district, but organizers said that would leave out many people who planned to join the march along the way.Police estimated that 190,000 people joined the peaceful march, the third major one in as many weeks. Organizers put the turnout at 550,000.The extradition proposal has heightened fears of eroding freedoms in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to China on July 1, 1997. Debate on the measure has been suspended indefinitely. Protesters want the bills formally withdrawn and Lam to resign.Lam, who has come under withering criticism for trying to push the legislation through, called a rare pre-dawn news conference with security officials Tuesday at police headquarters. She noted that two different protests happened Monday--one a generally orderly march that reflected Hong Kong's inclusiveness, the other using vandalism and violence.\"This is something we should seriously condemn,\" she said.Lam disputed protesters' complaints that officials had not responded to them, saying the government explained that by suspending the bill with no timetable or plan to revisit it, the legislation would die at the end of the current legislative session in July 2020.For the other demands, she said releasing arrested protesters without an investigation would not uphold the rule of law.The extradition bill controversy has given fresh momentum to Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition movement, awakening broader concerns that China is chipping away at the rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years under the \"one country, two systems\" framework. The two marches in June drew more than a million people, according to organizer estimates.Surveying damage to the building on Tuesday morning, Legislative Council President Andrew Leung said the previous night's violence had undermined \"the core values of Hong Kong.\" He said police were collecting evidence of criminal wrongdoing.\"I believe many Hong Kong people will share the same feeling with me that we are saddened by what happened last night.

When they broke into the Legislative Council on July 1, some shouted that the police were \u00e2\u0080\u009crubbish.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere were no indications of why the protesters decided to break into the building, and no specific action plan has been revealed.Some social media users criticized the demonstrators who took more violent action, saying the objective of the protest was to fight the extradition treaty, not the Legislative Council.Huge demonstrations have filled the streets in Hong Kong, demanding that the government withdraw the measure that would allow for the extradition of criminal suspects to face trial in mainland China.The Hong Kong government said it would temporarily suspend debate on the measure, but it did not withdraw it.That led to the latest round of protests.", "Protests escalate as Hong Kong marks handover to China,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,July,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Combative protesters tried to break into the Hong Kong legislature Monday as a crowd of thousands prepared to start a march in that direction on the 22nd anniversary of the former British colony's return to China.With a crowd of a hundred or so people around them, a small group of people repeatedly rammed a cargo cart into a glass panel of the building, wedging the cart partially through the damaged safety glass.The unexpected disruption stalled the start of the march Monday. The crowd has started filing out of Victoria Park but police asked the marchers to change their route or cancel the march.Both the combative protesters and the marchers oppose a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China to face trial. The proposal has increased fears of eroding freedoms in the territory that was returned to China in 1997.The embattled leader of Hong Kong pledged to be more responsive to public sentiment in a speech at a flag-raising ceremony. Carrie Lam has come under withering criticism for trying to push through the legislation. She said a series of protests and marches that have attracted hundreds of thousands of students and other participants in recent weeks have taught her that she needs to listen better to the youth and people in general.\"This has made me fully realize that I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,\" she said in a five-minute speech to the gathering in the city's cavernous convention center.She insisted her government has good intentions, but said \"I will learn the lesson and ensure that the government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community.\"Security guards pushed pro-democracy lawmaker Helena Wong out of the room as she walked backward shouting at Lam to resign and withdraw the \"evil\" legislation. She later told reporters she was voicing the grievances and opinions of the protesters, who could not get into the event.The annual march starting in the afternoon was expected to be larger than usual because the proposed extradition bill has awakened broader fears that China is eroding the freedoms and rights guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years under a \"one country, two systems\" framework. Two marches in June against the legislation drew more than a million people, according to organizer estimates.The government has suspended debate on the bill indefinitely, but protest leaders want it formally withdrawn and Lam's resignation. They also are demanding an independent inquiry into police actions during a June 12 protest, when officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who blocked the legislature on the day debate on the bill had been scheduled to resume.The police say the use of force was justified, but have largely since adopted softer tactics, even as protesters besieged police headquarters in recent days, pelting it with eggs and spray-painting slogans on its outer walls.The area around Golden Bauhinia Square, where the flag-raising ceremony took place, was blocked off from Saturday to prevent protesters from gathering to disrupt it. Before the morning ceremony, protesters trying to gain access to the square were driven back by officers with plastic shields and batons, the retreating protesters pointing open umbrellas to ward off pepper spray.\"We are horrified, this is our obligation to do this, we are protecting our home,\" said Jack, a 26-year-old office worker who would only give his first name. \"I don't know why the government is harming us. It's harming the rule of law, the rule of law is the last firewall between us and the Chinese Communist Party.\"", "Hong Kong braces for protests amid annual handover rally,REUTERS,July,1,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of protesters faced off with riot police early on Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, ahead of an annual rally that is expected to draw huge crowds amid widespread anger over a controversial extradition bill.More than a million people have taken to the streets at times over the past three weeks to vent their anger and frustration at Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam, posing the greatest popular challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.Opponents of the now-suspended extradition bill, which would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, fear it is a threat to Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law and are demanding it be scrapped and Lam step down.Police fired pepper spray to disperse some demonstrators, mostly black-clad students wearing hard hats and face masks, ahead of a flag-raising ceremony to mark the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule.Riot police with helmets and batons raced towards protesters at one point and held up red banners warning they would use force if the activists charged.A tired-looking Lam appeared in public for the first time in nearly two weeks to attend the anniversary ceremony, flanked by her husband and former Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa. Authorities deployed a huge security blanket around the venue.Lam said the government needed to change its style of governance to be more accommodating and open and pledged to do more for young people.\"The incident that happened in recent months has led to controversies and disputes between the public and the government. This has made me fully realize that I, as a politician, have to remind myself all the time of the need to grasp public sentiments accurately,\" Lam said.\"After this incident, I will learn the lesson and ensure that the government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community,\" she said.The anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to Beijing in 1997 has been marked in recent years by deepening despondency about what many Hong Kong residents see as a relentless march towards mainland control.Tensions spiraled on June 12 when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at anti-extradition protesters near the heart of the financial center, sending plumes of smoke billowing among some of the world's tallest skyscrapers.Lam's suspension of the bill, following the largest and most violent protests in decades, has done little to pacify opponents who are demanding it be scrapped altogether.The extradition law has hit a nerve across Hong Kong, drawing criticism from business people, legal circles, schools and church groups, and has plunged the Asian financial center into political turmoil.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.Beijing denies interfering. The uproar over the bill has reignited a protest movement that had lost steam after pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 failed to force concessions from Beijing and led to the arrests of hundreds of activists.Organizers of the recent protests say they are confident that anger over the government's failure to withdraw the extradition bill will boost numbers at the annual rally on Monday, a public holiday on which financial markets and most businesses will be closed.The pro-democracy rally is due to start at 0630 GMT in Victoria Park on Hong Kong island and end at government offices near the heart of the financial center.The recent demonstrations have brought havoc, forcing the closure of government offices on several occasions and triggering chaos as protesters blocked roads and besieged police headquarters.The South China Morning Post cited unidentified sources as saying about 5,000 riot police would be ready for any trouble.The turmoil comes at a delicate time for Beijing, which is grappling with a trade dispute with the United States, a faltering economy and tensions in the South China Sea.Lam said after suspending the bill she had heard the people \"loud and clear.\" However, she stopped short of activists' demands to scrap the bill altogether and rejected calls to step down.She is clinging to her job despite an unprecedented backlash against the government that has galvanized people from all walks of life to take to the streets in protest.Activists are also demanding the government drop charges against those arrested during the protests, charge police with what they describe as excessive use of force and stop referring to the demonstrations as a riot, a term that can bring a heavier jail sentence.Opponents of the extradition bill fear it would put them at the mercy of China's justice system, where human rights are not guaranteed.Beyond the public outcry, the extradition bill has spooked some of Hong Kong's tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details.", "In Taiwan, Hong Kong immigrants despair over future back home,REUTERS,June,30,2019": "TAINAN, Taiwan--Kitty Wong and Adolf Lim are tightening the screws on their future in Taiwan as they make the final touches to a hostel in the southern city of Tainan, that they hope will open its doors to holiday-makers next month.The couple from Hong Kong came to Taiwan in search of a stress-free life after being disappointed with the fragmentation of society back in Hong Kong, along with the daily negativity that they found hard to escape. This is the third hostel they are opening after arriving in 2016.\"The level of evil that you are dealing with is too high, I just see no way out,\" Yim says, talking about how the Chinese Communist Party is clamping down on freedom in his home town.It is not only the pressure from the mainland that made him pack his bags, but also daily acts of frustration that drive a wedge in society.\"As they are unable to attack Uncle Xi, they go ahead and attack tourists,\" he said, referring to the attitude of fellow Hong Kong citizens to visitors from the mainland, who are often resented for their perceived poor manners.\"I feel incapable to change the regime, but I am also unable to accept this sort of behavior.\"\"Recently, we've been getting a lot of inquiries,\" says Kitty Wong, referring to their status as something of a point of contact for Hong Kong citizens wanting to make the jump.Many of the Hong Kong people ask about the possibility of gaining citizenship in Taiwan as investors.The number of people granted Taiwan residency from Hong Kong and neighboring Macau, a former Portuguese enclave also given special autonomy under Chinese rule, has more than doubled to 1,267 in 2018 from a decade ago, official data shows.The trend spiked in the two years following big protests calling for full democracy in 2014 that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for months. And it shows no signs of abating.There were about 400 such immigrants to Taiwan in the first four months of 2019, a 40-percent jump from a year ago.Cafe owner Ricky Chang first came to Taiwan as a student and decided to settle down in Tainan in 2013 after several stints in other countries. He too is an often approached for advice by hopeful immigrants who are eager to gain citizenship in Taiwan in case things get too difficult in Hong Kong.Although he didn't move to Taiwan for political reasons, a proposed extradition law in Hong Kong has changed his thinking.\"I'm worried that I have been engaging in some behaviors that, although they are legal in Taiwan and don't go against the law, might be seen as violations of the law in mainland China and that there might come a day when I travel on a plane with a layover in Hong Kong or go back to Hong Kong to see my parents, that I might be arrested at the airport,\" he said.The extradition bill is the latest in a string of issues that have troubled ties between Hong Kong and Beijing, and sparked big protests in the financial hub.Hong Kong people have in recent years been increasingly upset by mainland immigrants and sky-high property prices partly pushed up by mainland investors.The influx of mainlanders into Hong Kong was the main reason that drove Joe Ching, an entrepreneur in the logistics sector who still has operations in Hong Kong, across the Taiwan Strait to find a future for his family of three.\"I moved to Taiwan to look for another way forward because I don't want my children to have any interaction or link with mainland Chinese,\" he says.He said Taiwan people should think carefully about who they vote into office as the stakes are increasingly high.China has proposed using the \"one country, two systems\" formula, under which Hong Kong returned from British rule in 1997, for Taiwan, in case of a \"reunification\" of the self-ruled island and China.Taiwan is claimed by China as part of its territory, though the Communist-run government in Beijing has never ruled Taiwan.", "From Okinawa to Hong Kong to snap images of people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power,By SHOHEI OKADA/ Staff Writer,June,29,2019": "NAHA--Asahi Fukuhara snaps pictures for a living and felt he could not ignore the huge demonstrations being staged in Hong Kong over a proposed extradition measure.So, the 24-year-old went over to the former British colony to capture images of the outpouring of anger.Fukuhara, an Okinawa native, felt a special closeness to the activists not only because they are young like himself, but also because he himself had been deeply involved in a petition drive that led to a prefectural referendum earlier this year on a contentious plan by the central government to build a new base for the U.S. military in the southernmost prefecture.The referendum resulted in more than 70 percent of people in Okinawa casting ballots opposed to the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from Ginowan to the Henoko district of Nago.Fukuhara joined the movement to promote dialogue between proponents and opponents of the relocation.Fukuhara had been following events in Hong Kong through Twitter and saw that many of his age and even younger were joining in the protests against the extradition measure that would have sent criminal suspects in Hong Kong for court proceedings in the Chinese mainland.When he saw police firing tear gas into a crowd, he felt he had to do something other than just observe events from Okinawa.He talked about what was happening in Hong Kong with friends over drinks on June 14 and booked a flight to Hong Kong the following day.With close to 2 million protesters taking to the streets of Hong Kong, Fukuhara said: \"It felt like the ground was shaking. Their loud shouts against the measure resonated with my heart.\"He began snapping away at the crowd passing before him.A particularly large rally was held on June 16. Many of the participants were young people, with some couples also marching. Fukuhara continued to follow the protests until June 23.He took about 6,000 photos in total. He also shot video footage that he posted to Twitter and that was replayed about 20,000 times.What he saw in Hong Kong reminded Fukuhara in many ways of what is also happening in Okinawa.\"I thought they were very much like us,\" he said. \"The public will was on the verge of being crushed by the huge authority that is the state.\"Despite the overwhelming opposition in Okinawa to the Futenma relocation, land reclamation work continues unabated off the coast of Henoko waters.One sign Fukuhara saw in Hong Kong calling on the authorities to listen to the voice of the people gave him a hint of what was needed in Okinawa.He felt the decision to postpone implementation of the extradition measure was due in large part to the international attention attracted by the outpouring of anger in Hong Kong.That led him to conclude that the only way to change the status quo in Okinawa is to \"continue with our appeals to the world without abandoning hope.\"", "G-20 leaders facing calls to protect growth, open trade,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,28,2019": "OSAKA--World leaders attending a Group of 20 summit in Japan that began Friday are clashing over the values that have served for decades as the foundation of their cooperation as they face calls to fend off threats to economic growth.\"A free and open economy is the basis for peace and prosperity,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told his counterparts in opening the two-day G-20 meeting that comes as leaders grapple with profound tensions over trade, globalization and the collapsing nuclear deal with Iran.While groups like the G-20 endeavor to forge consensus on broad policy approaches and geopolitical issues, the rifts between them run both shallow and deep.Defying Chinese warnings not to bring up the issue of recent protests in Hong Kong, Abe cautioned Chinese President Xi Jinping over Beijing's human rights record.In a meeting late Thursday, Abe told Xi it is important for \"a free and open Hong Kong to prosper under 'one country, two systems' policy,\" Japanese officials said, referring to the arrangement for the former British colony's autonomy when China took control in 1997.They said Abe reminded Xi of the importance of guaranteeing freedom, human rights, the \"rule of law\" and other universal values in raising concern over proposed Hong Kong legislation that would allow some criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in mainland China. The bill, now shelved, drew hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents into the streets in protests.Xi is not the only leader facing a pushback from his Western counterparts.European Union Council President Donald Tusk blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for saying in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper that liberalism was \"obsolete\" and conflicts with the \"overwhelming majority\" in many countries.\"We are here as Europeans also to firmly and unequivocally defend and promote liberal democracy,\" Tusk told reporters. \"What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\"Tusk told reporters that such comments suggest a belief that \"freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete.\"Putin praised U.S. President Donald Trump for his efforts to try to stop the flow of migrants and drugs from Mexico and said that liberalism \"presupposes that nothing needs to be done. That migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected.\"Trump has at times found himself at odds with other leaders in such international events, particularly on issues such as Iran, climate change and trade.A planned meeting between Trump and the Chinese president on Saturday as the G-20 meetings conclude has raised hopes for a detente in the tariffs war between the world's two largest economies.The two sides have levied billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on each other's imports in a festering dispute over technology and the chronic Chinese trade surplus.In a meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Trump said he had not promised to hold back on imposing new tariffs on China.\"I think it'll be productive,\" Trump said of his meeting with Xi. \"We'll see what happens tomorrow. It'll be a very exciting day I'm sure,\" he said. \"It's going to come out hopefully well for both countries.\"U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross accompanied Trump to Osaka, suggesting potential for some movement after 11 rounds of talks stalled in May.But while prospects for detente in the trade war are in the spotlight, many participating prefer a broader approach to tackling global crises.\"I am deeply concerned over the current global economic situation. The world is paying attention to the direction we, the G-20 leaders, are moving toward,\" Abe said. \"We need to send strong message, which is to support and strengthen a free, fair and indiscriminatory trade system.\"A breakthrough is not assured. On Thursday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing reiterated that China is determined to defend itself against further U.S. moves to penalize it over trade friction. China often has sought to gain support for defending global trade agreements against Trump's \"America First\" stance in gatherings like the G-20.Abe has sought to make the Osaka summit a landmark for progress on environmental issues, including climate change, on cooperation in developing new rules for the \"digital economy,\" such as devising fair ways to tax companies like Google and Facebook, and on strengthening precautions against abuse of technologies such as cyber-currencies to fund terrorism and other types of Internet-related crimes.On the rising tensions between Iran and the United States, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world can't afford the conflict and it was \"essential to de-escalate the situation\" and avoid confrontation. Iran is soon poised to surpass a key uranium stockpile threshold, threatening the nuclear accord it reached with world powers in 2015.Iran's moves come after Trump announced in May 2018 that he was pulling the United States out of the deal and reimposing economic sanctions on Tehran.In a letter to the leaders in Osaka, Guterres urged them to take action on equitable and stable reforms to strengthen the global financial safety net and increase the global economy's resilience.While there are good plans and vision, what's needed are \"accelerated actions, not more deliberations,\" he said.Fast and equal economic growth should be constructed so that people who live in \"the 'rust belts' of the world are not left behind,\" he said.The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, in a meeting on the G-20 sidelines, called for joint efforts to stabilize international trade and oppose protectionism.Putin, whose country faces an array of U.S. and EU sanctions, said at the meeting that \"international trade has suffered from protectionism, politically motivated restrictions and barriers.\" Putin also emphasized the need for BRICS nations to take coordinated action to help block sources of funding for terrorist groups.", "Abe, Xi stress closer ties while casting wary eye on Trump at G-20,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,June,28,2019": "OSAKA--Prime Minister Shinzo Abe played up Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improved relations with China on June 27, apparently in hopes of setting the tone for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.Abe and Xi met here before the formal start of the Group of 20 summit on June 28, and the prime minister wanted to capitalize on the fact that it was Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first visit to Japan as Chinese president.During their meeting, Abe told Xi he wanted to welcome him \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor a state visit in spring next year when the cherry blossoms are blooming.\u00e2\u0080\u009dXi responded that the proposal was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood idea.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlthough their meeting was held on the sidelines of the G-20 summit, Abe emphasized the importance of Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit by then hosting a dinner reception for the Chinese president.Behind the apparent blossoming friendship between Abe and Xi was a meeting scheduled for June 29 between the Chinese leader and the unpredictable and often confrontational president of the United States.With the United States and China now engaged in a bitter trade war, Abe, as host of the G-20 summit, does not want to see a blowup between Xi and Trump during their talks.Such a confrontation could have a major negative effect on the results of the summit and leave mud on Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as the Upper House election looms next month.Xi told Abe in their meeting that it would be important for any declaration emerging from the G-20 summit to contain wording about \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotecting multilateralism and free trade.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat was apparently meant to show China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for the summit host to bring together a declaration that can be agreed upon by all the leaders, including Trump.At the start of his meeting with Xi, Abe said bilateral relations with China had completely returned to a more normal course, adding that he wanted to create a new age for Japan-China ties by working closely with Xi.Xi responded that relations between the two nations stood at \u00e2\u0080\u009ca new and historic starting line.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter the meeting, Yasutoshi Nishimura, a deputy chief Cabinet secretary, briefed reporters and touched upon the \u00e2\u0080\u009ceternal neighbors\u00e2\u0080\u009d term used by Abe to describe the bilateral relationship.Nishimura said the two nations had to engage in constant and close communications because of their geographical relations. He added that despite the many issues between the two countries, the relationship could be managed and improved by building trust through mutual visits by the two leaders.During their hourlong meeting, Xi explained about his recent visit to Pyongyang for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Xi told Abe that he passed on to Kim the prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readiness to unconditionally hold talks with the North Korean leader.Abe also requested restraint from Beijing concerning Chinese ships entering Japanese territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea.In apparent reference to the huge protests in Hong Kong over proposed legislation to extradite criminal suspects to China for court proceedings, Abe said it was important to guarantee universal values, such as respect for human rights and rule of law.Abe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reference to the territorial dispute over the Senkakus highlights the reality behind China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more friendly approach at the top leader level.China still refers to the Diaoyu Islands as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccore interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d from which it cannot be seen to be backing away.Intrusions by Chinese government-related vessels into Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territorial waters around the Senkakus have occurred at a pace of three or four times a month, and the total number this year has already reached the same level for all of 2018.Chinese ships have also been spotted in the contiguous zone just outside territorial waters for a record 64 straight days.\"It is clear China is trying to back up its territorial claim by giving the impression that its ships are constantly in those waters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Japanese government source said.No progress has been made in talks about joint development of oil fields in the East China Sea.

Nearly 300 flights were already cancelled since its cabin crew went on strike on June 20, including flights from Taipei to Chicago, Paris, Seoul and Hong Kong.The week-long strike, which is the longest in Taiwan's aviation industry where labor unrest is uncommon, has led Eva to estimate a revenue loss of about T$1.34 billion ($43.16 million or 4.7 billion yen).The union representing Eva Air's flight attendants made several concessions on Thursday on its demands to improve work conditions and pay, having failed to reach an agreement with the airline's management after a months-long negotiation.\"The union has adjusted our proposal and is urging Eva Air to restart the negotiation as soon as possible,\" it said in a statement. \"We have been hoping that Eva Airways would restart negotiations swiftly to resolve the dispute.\"Eva Air said it was still working on a statement when contacted by Reuters.

Teresa Cheng, come out,\" the protesters chanted, referring to the justice secretary, interspersed with another demand, \"Condemn excessive force by police and release protesters.\"Early on Thursday, riot police wielding batons and shields chased dozens of protesters who had besieged police headquarters through the streets of Wan Chai, a popular nightspot.The government said while it respected the public's right to peaceful assembly it was unacceptable for protesters to block roads and surround police headquarters.The demonstrators have seized on this week's Group of 20 summit of world leaders in Japan to appeal for Hong Kong's plight to be put on the agenda, a move certain to rile Beijing, which has vowed not to tolerate such discussion.\"We know that the G-20 is coming.

The two companies indicated that they would complete the procedures necessary for the investment by June 27.Attention is now focused on whether Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support will make it easier for Harvest and Oasis to decide to invest in JDI.", "Protesters urging G-20 to discuss Hong Kong issues,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,26,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong activists opposed to contentious extradition legislation on Wednesday called on leaders of the United States, the European Union and others to raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping at this week's Group of 20 summit in Japan.Beijing has strongly opposed such a development, saying Hong Kong matters are strictly an internal Chinese affair.Groups of protesters gathered outside the U.S. and EU consulates Wednesday morning to deliver petitions stating their requests.A spokesman said changes to the Chinese territory's legislation could expose citizens of all nationalities to being extradited to China for unfair trials and possible torture, reducing Hong Kong's judicial independence and the civil liberties it retained after the handover from British rule in 1997.Activists planned to present petitions at 19 consulates in total and planned further protest actions for Wednesday evening following an expected vote of no-confidence in the local legislature on the administration of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Government supporters have a solid majority in the assembly and the measure is not expected to pass.Lam's push to pass the extradition bills has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to fill Hong Kong's streets in protest marches, while smaller groups have surrounded government offices, the legislature and police headquarters. They are demanding the total withdrawal of the legislation and accountability for heavy-handed police treatment of protesters at a protest earlier this month during which tear gas and rubber bullets were fired.Lam has shelved the legislation and apologized for not better handling the matter but has declined to respond to other demands.Several foreign governments, along with legal, commercial, human rights and media groups in Hong Kong, have expressed concern about the legislation as well as the Hong Kong government's handling of the protests.In a statement Tuesday in the House of Commons, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he raised the issue with Lam on June 12.Britain urges Hong Kong to establish a \"robust, independent investigation\" into the violence against protesters, and will not issue further export licenses for crowd control equipment to Hong Kong \"unless we are satisfied that concerns raised on human rights and fundamental freedoms have been thoroughly addressed,\" Hunt said.China says it fully backs Lam's administration's and has rejected foreign commentary over the protests and the extradition issue as interference in its internal affairs.At a briefing in Beijing on Monday, Zhang Jun, an assistant foreign minister, said, \"I can tell you that for sure the G-20 will not discuss the issue of Hong Kong and we will not allow the G-20 to discuss the issue of Hong Kong.\"Hong Kong's government \"has taken a series of measures to safeguard fairness and justice of society and to block loopholes in the legal system.

He had pleaded not guilty to misconduct charges in late 2015.The Court of Appeal sent Tsang back to jail in July 2018 for 12 months following the dismissal of an appeal and he was released in January after suffering health issues throughout his sentence.Tsang was jailed on a charge of misconduct in public office for failing to declare certain dealings with a business tycoon.The Court of Final Appeal on Wednesday quashed his conviction and sentence, and said there would be no retrial.\"The appellant has already suffered what the Court of Appeal considered a just punishment for the offense in respect of which he would be re-tried,\" the court said in its ruling.\"That weighs heavily in favor of a conclusion that the interests of justice do not require a new trial. There should not be such an order.\"Tsang, known for his love of bow ties, received a knighthood from Britain's Queen Elizabeth. He was respected for pushing political reforms and helping to stave off speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar during the 2008 financial crisis.The legal battle began in 2015 when Tsang was charged with misconduct in public office in a trial that centered around allegations of lavish spending on overseas duty visits and taking trips with tycoons by private jet and luxury yacht.Tsang and his defense had stressed his years of upstanding public service during the trial. They maintained that he had done nothing wrong.", "Hong Kong protests warn that special freedoms are fading,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,26,2019": "HONG KONG--China promised that for 50 years after Britain gave up control of its last colony, this shimmering financial enclave would get to keep freedoms absent in the communist-ruled mainland. Twenty-two years on, those are rights many here believe Hong Kong cannot live without.The hundreds of thousands who marched in a June 16 protest over a now-shelved extradition bill, and those still demonstrating, are raising alarm that Hong Kong may become just another Chinese city as those protections unravel and Beijing's influence in the territory expands.Activists are planning more protests for Wednesday, hoping to win attention and support from world leaders gathering in Osaka, Japan, for the Group of 20 summit later this week.\"This is not about a power struggle,\" said Bonnie Leung, a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, one of a number of groups involved in organizing protests. \"This is about the values that make the world a better place.\"\"The whole world, whoever has connections with Hong Kong, would be stakeholders,\" she said.All of those involved--the territory's top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the police, lawmakers, the protesters and the rest of Hong Kong--are caught up in tensions stemming from the \"one country, two systems\" colonial legacy that bequeathed a Western-style civic society under a political system controlled by Beijing.The protests erupted after Beijing-backed Lam tried to push through legislation that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to face trial in Communist Party-dominated courts in mainland China. Many in Hong Kong viewed the bill as another step toward curbing protections they expect from their legal system.While they come from all walks of life, the protesters share a determination to preserve those freedoms, said Samson Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.\"This protest has drawn everybody in town together,\" he said. \"They really value the freedom to speak up and protest.\"Jerome A. Cohen, a leading expert on Chinese law and government, said the extradition bill would have deprived local authorities of the right to prevent forcible transfers by China of suspects, including visitors, \"for detention, trial and punishment that violate international standards of justice.\"The bill also would have enabled China to require Hong Kong authorities to freeze and confiscate assets of alleged suspects, Cohen wrote in a recent blog post. Efforts to limit the cases subject to extradition would not prevent suspects from being subject to China's \"incommunicado torture chambers, its denial of competent legal defenders and its unfair trials.\"Most Hong Kong residents belong to families that fled poverty and political upheavals in the communist mainland. British rule did not bequeath them democracy, but it laid the foundations for strong civic institutions, schools, health care--as well as a laissez faire trading regime dominated by business leaders deeply invested in keeping Hong Kong as it is.Normally reluctant to wade into political matters or criticize Beijing, businesses also expressed concern over the extradition bill, with the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce noting that the protests reflected \"serious apprehensions.\" The chamber welcomed the government's decision to suspend the bill, as did its American and British counterparts.It's unclear if the turnout for another big protest planned for the July 1 anniversary of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to Chinese control might match the earlier ones.Lam's push for the now stalled legislation, ill-timed around the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, and the tear gas, steel batons and other aggressive tactics used by police, especially in June 12 protests that turned violent, helped draw people young and old into the streets.Activists want an investigation into the complaints over police violence, along with Lam's resignation and other demands. But the continued protests reflect a deeper sense of grievance and unease, especially among Hong Kong residents coming of age in an era of declining economic opportunity, said Ken Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings.\"Social mobility is more and more theoretical in Hong Kong, so young people continue to be very dissatisfied. There's a broader concern about China in Hong Kong. The economy's not growing like people thought it would grow,\" Courtis said.In many respects, Hong Kong faces the same sorts of challenges of other developed economies with aging populations and slowing growth.The city of 7 million has an economy that is bigger than Vietnam's and a per capita GDP of more than $46,000 (5 million yen). But controls on land use favor property developers, and half the apartments available rent for $2,550 a month or more, while median monthly incomes are about $2,300.In a city dominated by business leaders and other elites, the only leverage protesters can wield is \"the power of numbers,\" said Yuen, noting that surveys of those participating in protests in recent weeks generally identify with the city's \"grassroots or lower classes.\"\"They see themselves as lower class because of crony capitalism in Hong Kong. It's very hard for them to get a fine paying job and also to buy an apartment in Hong Kong,\" he said.Brian Chow, one of the protesters sitting in the sweltering heat on a recent day outside the city's Legislative Council building, said he wasn't the \"type\" to get involved in violence.\"I'll just carry on sitting here, sing some Christian hymns, show our resistance, keep the government paralyzed until it responds to us,\" he said.After protesters blocked lines in the tax and immigration offices downtown on Monday, the government issued a statement appealing to them to \"act peacefully and rationally when expressing their opinions and not to affect those in need of government services.\"In her apologies over the extradition bill fiasco, Lam appealed for \"another chance\" and said she would focus on improving the economy and resolving the housing crisis.Chinese officials warned against \"outside interference\" but made a point of backing Lam's decision to sideline the proposal. At a time of severe trade friction with the United States, Beijing's higher priority lies in preserving Hong Kong's status as a financial hub and free port, Courtis said.\"People in Beijing are pragmatic. They see time in terms of many years,\" he said. \"Step sideways here, if that's not enough then step backwards. Now you focus on making the economy work and keeping people happy.\"", "3 Chinese banks face U.S. action in sanctions probe--report,REUTERS,June,25,2019": "Three large Chinese banks could lose their access to the U.S. financial system after a judge found them in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas in a probe into violation of North Korean sanctions, The Washington Post reported on Monday.The three banks are not identified by the judge, but details in the court ruling align with a 2017 civil forfeiture action against Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, according to the report.The U.S. Department of Justice back then accused the banks of working with a Hong Kong company, which allegedly laundered over $100 million (10.7 billion yen) for North Korea's sanctioned Foreign Trade Bank, according to the paper.A spokesman at China Merchants Bank said he was aware of the report but could not immediately comment. Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Bank of Communications could not be reached immediately for comment.The report comes as the United States and China have been engaged in a trade dispute for months on issues such as tariffs, subsidies, technology, intellectual property and cyber security, among others.The U.S. government has put some Chinese companies, including telecommunications equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., on a trade blacklist while China is also drawing up its own \"Unreliable Entities List\" of foreign firms, groups and individuals.U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet this week at the Group of 20 summit in Japan hoping to calm their 11-month trade war.", "Protesters block Hong Kong building access, plan new action,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,24,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters fearing an erosion of Hong Kong's legal autonomy blocked access to a government office building for nearly two hours Monday and plan more demonstrations to draw the attention of leaders attending the Group of 20 summit this week.About 100 demonstrators jammed the entryway and lobby of the Inland Revenue Tower, a skyscraper in the Wan Chai district in the city center.Earlier, one of the main protest groups announced a demonstration planned on Wednesday to try to draw the attention of world leaders attending the G-20 summit in Japan.The leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front said they hope the world leaders meeting in Osaka will hear the protesters' concerns over the weakening of the city's legal autonomy by mainland China.Hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets and sidewalks in recent weeks to oppose legislation seen as increasing Beijing's control and police treatment of the protesters. The activists spoke on Monday near the city government headquarters, where a few protesters remained though the offices in the building had reopened.Kelvin Ho, one of the group's several leaders, said the protest was meant to \"urge the international community to give stress on Beijing that we need democracy.\"China has rejected foreign commentary over the protests and the extradition issue as interference in its internal affairs.At a briefing in Beijing, Zhang Jun, an assistant foreign minister, said \"I can tell you that for sure the G-20 will not discuss the issue of Hong Kong and we will not allow the G-20 to discuss the issue of Hong Kong.\"Hong Kong's government \"has taken a series of measures to safeguard fairness and justice of society and to block loopholes in the legal system.

The extradition legislation would enable some suspects to be sent from Hong Kong to stand trial in mainland Chinese courts.The opponents' concern is that suspects might be pursued for corrupt or political reasons and be unable to get fair trials in courts dominated by the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Bonnie Leung, another leader in the Civil Human Rights Front, said the extradition bill, which has been indefinitely shelved for now, would affect not just Hong Kong residents but potentially anyone visiting the city.\"The whole world who have connection with HK would be stakeholders,\" she said. \"This is not about a power struggle.

There were rumors in Washington for weeks that Pence would soften the tone of his follow-up address, or cancel it altogether. White House officials had repeatedly said plans had not changed, though they were tight-lipped about the details.While Pence held his fire, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday highlighted Chinese abuses in announcing the release of the State Department's 2018 Report on International Religious Freedom.Pompeo told reporters the department had added a special section to the report \"in an effort to document the staggering scope of religious freedom abuses in Xinjiang.\"While talking about sensitive issues may have risked casting a chill over Trump's meeting with Xi, postponing the Pence speech could embolden Beijing, said Ely Ratner, a former national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.\"It sends a terrible message to China that America won't stand firm, that everything is negotiable with President Trump, even core U.S. values and interests,\" said Ratner, now at the Center for a New American Security.Pence aides first announced he would give another speech on China on May 29, raising concerns in China and the U.S. business community that tough rhetoric on human rights and other issues could damage chances for a trade war detente.The timing was also sensitive after recent mass demonstrations in Hong Kong and the June 4 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Pompeo drew an angry response from China for a statement on the Tiananmen anniversary, and Beijing has told Washington to stay out of the Hong Kong issue.As well as seeking a resolution to the trade issue, the United States has been looking to China to step up pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, a major foreign policy issue for Trump.Xi visited North Korea for the first time this week and said the world hoped for successful U.S.-North Korea talks, which have stalled since a failed summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.", "Latest Hong Kong protest ends peacefully with demands unmet,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,22,2019": "HONG KONG--Protesters in Hong Kong besieged police headquarters late into the night Friday, throwing eggs at the building and drawing graffiti on the walls, before ending a day of demonstrations in the Asian financial center with their demands unmet.By daybreak Saturday, police had cleared the streets of barriers set up by protesters to snarl traffic in the Asian financial center, and only a few groups in the mostly youthful crowd remained. Many slept outside the Legislature.Some demonstrators said in TV interviews that they had made their point but were disappointed that neither the police nor government leaders had come to talk to them.Hong Kong has been rocked by major protests for the past two weeks over legislative proposals that many view as eroding the territory's judicial independence and, more broadly, as a sign of Chinese government efforts to chip away at the freedoms of the semi-autonomous city.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam indefinitely suspended debate on the bills a week ago, making it likely they would die. But protesters are demanding that she formally withdraw the proposed changes to the extradition laws. Some also want her to resign.The peaceful ending to Friday's protests drew a sigh of relief in the city of 7.4 million people, after police unleashed tear gas and rubber bullets last week in violent clashes with protesters that left dozens injured on both sides.Police were previously criticized for their use of force but this time waited out the protesters. Police did issue a statement at 4:50 a.m. condemning them for blocking key streets and seriously disrupting work at police headquarters.\"Police have shown the greatest tolerance to the protesters who assembled outside PHQ, but their means of expressing views have become illegal, irrational and unreasonable,\" the statement said in part.Activist Joshua Wong called on police to answer demands over heavy-handed tactics used during a mass protest on June 12, including the firing of 150 rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, and the beating of unarmed protesters by police with truncheons.\"We ... urge police to apologize to the people\" over the use of such tactics and their labeling of the gathering as a riot, Wong said.While anger seemed to be turning away from civil authorities and toward the police, the mostly black-clad protesters continued to try to shut down the entire government complex, as they have tried off-and-on for the past two weeks.During the afternoon, some sought to build barriers on Connaught Road, the main thoroughfare in the area known as Admiralty, building barriers of stones, pylons and other materials at hand, at one time temporarily blocking in a police van.Around police headquarters, masked and helmeted protesters covered surveillance cameras with masking tape and lashed barriers together with nylon cable ties.The auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong's Catholic diocese, the Rev. Joseph Ha, appealed to the protesters to avoid violence. He warned that public opinion could turn against them.\"You have already been on the roads for a long time,\" he said on Cable TV Hong Kong. \"You've already done a lot. You have already expressed very clearly your hopes and wishes. But I am really worried about your personal safety. ... Please, absolutely, do not use violence.\"Protest leaders have said they are determined to keep up the pressure on Lam, who has insisted the bills are needed to uphold justice. But critics see them as part of a campaign by Beijing to diminish Hong Kong's democratic institutions.\"I myself am not the type to get involved in violence,\" student protester Brian Chow said. \"I'll just carry on sitting here, sing some Christian hymns, show our resistance, and keep the government paralyzed until it responds to us.\"Many protesters have been wary of giving their full names and some have obscured their features with facemasks to guard their identities against potential retribution from government or school authorities.Government offices were ordered closed Friday \"due to security considerations,\" and hearings at the Legislative Council were suspended.Since the confrontations June 12, police have eased their approach, hoping to avoid a replay of 2014 protests, when officers unleashed 87 rounds of tear gas at protesters in the same location as the current protests.When the smoke from that response cleared, bigger crowds returned, angrier than before, and didn't leave for nearly three months.The bills would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include mainland China, Taiwan and Macau. Legal and business groups in Hong Kong oppose the legislation, saying critics of China's ruling Communist Party would be at risk of torture and unfair trials on the mainland and that it further chips away at the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which Hong Kong has been governed since 1997.That framework guaranteed the territory the right to retain its own legal, economic and political system for 50 years, but the Communist Party under Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pushing ever more aggressively to quiet independent voices in Hong Kong. Beijing has squelched all reporting on the protests in mainland media and accused foreign forces of stirring up disturbances in Hong Kong.Opposition to the legislation has come from a broad range of civic, human rights, legal profession and commercial organizations.On Friday, the Hong Kong Bar Association reiterated is criticisms, saying Lam's decision to suspend but not withdraw the bill was \"wholly unsatisfactory\" because it could still dictate the parameters of future consultation on the issues of surrender of fugitives and cross-border legal assistance.The association also called for the setting up of an independent commission to investigate the June 12 violence, including whatever guidelines existed on the use of force by police against demonstrators.Amnesty International went a step further, saying police must \"end the unlawful use of force against peaceful protesters,\" and issuing a report documenting 14 incidents of apparent police violence on June 12.Officers appeared \"out of control, placing peaceful protesters who posed no threat in danger of serious injury,\" Man-kei Tam, the group's Hong Kong director, said in a statement.", "Filipino ex-envoy says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being held at Hong Kong airport,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,21,2019": "MANILA--A former Philippine foreign secretary who accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of crimes against humanity in court said Friday he was barred from immediately entering Hong Kong and held at the airport for unclear reasons.Former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario told The Associated Press by telephone that he flew to Hong Kong on Friday for a business meeting but was blocked by immigration officers from entering. He said he was later brought and held in a small airport immigration lounge.Immigration personnel told him an unspecified \"case\" they could not specify was the reason why he was not allowed to enter the territory immediately. At the time he talked with the AP by cellphone, he said he had already been held for two hours.\"I keep reminding them that I'm traveling on a diplomatic passport and according to the Vienna Convention, they have no right to hold me,\" del Rosario said, referring to the international treaty that specifies the privileges of diplomats to carry out their work without fear of coercion by a host country.Del Rosario said he was told he would be moved to another airport area shortly to have a discussion with an immigration official.Last May, former Philippine Supreme Court Justice and top anti-graft prosecutor Conchita Carpio-Morales said she was also barred for about four hours from entering Hong Kong for a vacation with her family and ordered to take a flight back to Manila.Hong Kong airport and immigration officials later told her \"there was a mistake\" and that she could proceed with her trip to Hong Kong, but she and her family had already decided to return home because of the incident, she said at the time.Del Rosario and Carpio-Morales took the bold step of filing a complaint before the International Criminal Court against Xi and other Chinese officials over Beijing's assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, which they say deprived thousands of fishermen of their livelihoods and destroyed the environment.They accused Xi and other Chinese officials of turning seven disputed reefs into man-made islands, causing extensive environmental damage, and of blocking large numbers of fishermen, including about 320,000 Filipinos, from their fishing grounds.Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua to Manila then called the complaint a \"fabrication.\" Chinese officials also raised their concern over the complaint in a meeting with Philippine officials in Manila in April, saying the case is \"affecting the prestige of our leader,\" a Philippine official told the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.When del Rosario was Philippine foreign secretary, he also spearheaded the filing of an arbitration case to challenge the legal basis of China's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea on historical grounds. The Philippine move was sparked by a standoff between Filipino and Chinese ships in 2013 in the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing later effectively seized.An international arbitration panel invalidated China's territorial claims in a 2016 ruling and upheld the Philippines' right to exploit marine resources, including potential undersea oil and gas deposits, in its exclusive economic zone, a stretch of coastal waters. China has ignored and defied the arbitration decision.The legal offensive against China contrasted with President Rodrigo Duterte's rapprochement with Beijing since he took office in mid-2016 while often criticizing the security policies of the United States, a treaty ally.Del Rosario has said that he and Carpio-Morales filed the complaint against Xi and other Chinese officials \"to be able to push back against the bullying and harassment that we have been encountering from our goliath of a neighbor.\"", "Black-clad protesters demand full withdrawal of extradition bill,REUTERS,June,21,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of people dressed in black rallied in Hong Kong on Friday after the expiry of a deadline protesters set for the government to scrap a controversial extradition bill--the latest wave of protests to rock the Chinese-ruled city.Demonstrators, mostly students, gathered peacefully outside the legislature in sweltering heat of about 30 degrees Celsius to vent their anger and frustration at Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam who promoted, and then postponed the bill after mass protests last week.Some protesters on Friday tried to block key roads near the heart of the financial center in scenes reminiscent of democracy protests in late 2014, sparking early morning traffic chaos.Lam's suspension of the bill, that would allow people to be extradited to the mainland to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, has done little to pacify opponents, who are demanding it be axed.\"We want to fight for our freedom,\" said high school student Chan Pak-lam, 17, outside Hong Kong's political headquarters, which was temporarily shut on Friday due to security concerns.\"We want the law to be withdrawn, not suspended. I will stay here until tonight, 10 p.m. maybe. If the government doesn't respond, we will come again.\"Millions have clogged the streets of the financial hub this month to protest against the extradition bill, which they fear will erode Hong Kong's legal system, triggering some of the most violent protests in decades when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowds.The protesters on Friday demanded the government drop all charges against those arrested during last week's violent protests, charge police with what they describe as violent action and stop referring to the protests as a riot.Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng became the latest government minister to apologize over the bill, which has plunged the former British colony into political turmoil.\"Regarding the controversies and disputes in society arising from the strife in the past few months, being a team member of the government, I offer my sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong,\" Cheng wrote in her blog on Friday.\"We promise to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public.\"Since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including a much-cherished independent judiciary.But many accuse China of obstructing democratic reforms, interfering with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.Embattled Lam has stopped short of axing the bill, unnerving many who fear the law could put them at the mercy of the mainland Chinese justice system which is plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions. Courts in mainland China are controlled by the Communist Party.While Lam admitted shortcomings over the bill and said she has heard the people \"loud and clear,\" she has rejected repeated calls to step down. The snowballing backlash has raised questions over Lam's ability to govern effectively.Concerns over the extradition bill spread quickly from initially democratic and human rights groups to the wider Hong Kong community, including pro-establishment business figures, some usually loath to contradict the government.Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore over the extradition bill.As protesters sat or lay chatting outside the government headquarters, one activist read out a letter sent from a Taiwan student in support of the demonstrators.\"Brave HKers, perhaps when faced with adversity, we are all fragile and small, but please do not give up defending everything that you love, please believe your efforts are meaningful and powerful,\" the protester read through a loud hailer, as the crowds clapped and cheered.Beijing has never renounced the use of force to take over self-ruled Taiwan, which it regards as a recalcitrant, breakaway province. Many have waved Taiwan flags at recent demonstrations in Hong Kong, images certain to rile authorities in Beijing.Taiwan, overwhelmingly opposed to a \"one country, two systems\" formula for itself, has voiced support for Hong Kong.After promises that post-handover Hong Kong should enjoy a high degree of autonomy, Beijing's squeeze has fueled widespread resentment and in 2014 sparked pro-democracy protests that paralyzed parts of the city for 79 days.", "Hong Kong activists urge protesters to register to vote,REUTERS,June,20,2019": "HONG KONG--Campaigners in Hong Kong have registered thousands of new voters during mass protests against controversial extradition law reform, pouncing on an opportunity to bolster the democratic opposition's prospects in upcoming elections.The city's pro-democracy camp needs a strong showing in citywide legislative polls next year to recapture a big enough bloc to veto proposals from pro-establishment rivals, who now dominate the 70-seat legislature.A grassroots district council poll will also be held in November. That has traditionally been heavily swayed by pro-Beijing allies mobilizing supporters across the city.Electoral rules after Hong Kong's 1997 return to China from Britain effectively guarantee that the legislature, known as Legco, is stacked in Beijing's favor, with only half the parliament directly elected.But in the current controversy, public anger has centered on Beijing-backed Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her allies in trying to ram through the unpopular extradition bill, nudging many previously neutral citizens to take a stand.\"I'm not even registered because, honestly, before, I felt like they don't need one more person,\" said 24-year-old Christine Man, who filled out her first voter registration form at a rally against the extradition bill. \"If all of us stand up, it is a lot.\"Demonstrations last week, marred by violence, were followed by a march on Sunday that organizers said drew nearly 2 million people opposed to the bill, which would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China.At the Sunday march, singer and activist Denise Ho and volunteers from her NGO, Reimagine Hong Kong, collected and submitted about 3,000 voter registration forms, and handed out another 12,000. Registration drives are uncommon in Hong Kong, she said.\"For the people, this moment is very critical,\" Ho told Reuters.Hong Kong's 18 district councils don't formulate policy but control public spending at the local level. They are also training grounds for up-and-coming politicians, said Samson Yuen, an associate professor of political science at Lingnan University.The district councils are dominated by pro-Beijing parties.Winning district councils could help boost representation in the 1,200 member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive.Half of Legco's 70 seats are popularly elected and the rest are picked by business and professional groups called \"functional constituencies,\" which are dominated by pro-Beijing figures.In 2016, the pan-democratic camp won 29 seats--more than enough to wield veto power--but then lost six when these candidates were disqualified after China's national parliament ruled their oaths of office were invalid.About 2.2 million people voted in that election, or 58 percent of total registered voters, government data show. Less than 1.5 million people, or 47 percent of registered voters, cast ballots in district council elections the year before.The legislature \"is a very important battleground for us because it's a firewall between the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Chinese government, which is controlling everything,\" Ho said, referring to the territory's mini-Constitution.Ho, who is also an LGBT activist and staunch supporter of the pro-democracy Occupy movement, is continuing the push to enlist new voters ahead of the July 2 deadline for registration for the district council polls.About 30 local shops have said they would offer registration forms to customers, and Reimagine Hong Kong volunteers plan to set up 12 booths around the city to try to sign up more voters.Ho says that her star power has helped the campaign, but that drawing other entertainers into the effort has been tough because most in Hong Kong rely on the mainland market, where Ho has been banned since supporting the protests in 2014.Most of the demonstrators have been relatively young, and youth are under-represented among the electorate, Ho said. They are also potentially sympathetic to the pro-democracy parties, while the pro-Beijing camp's base includes more older citizens.Hong Kong's embattled leader, Lam, apologized this week for her government's poor handling of the extradition controversy and said she would redouble her engagement with youths.But critics say that is not enough and are continuing the fight.\"I'm quite sure, given what is happening right now, the pro-democracy camp will definitely have an upper hand,\" Yuen said of the upcoming elections.How big a boost the pro-democracy camp will get remains to be seen.\"This protest has been against the extradition bill. There is no political ideology or ideas of where this is going. People are not even talking about universal suffrage or resulting political reform. It's a very defensive movement,\" Yuen said.Man, the would-be new voter, said the extradition saga has been a catalyst in her political awakening.\"I know that Hong Kong is a part of China, and I'm not saying that we should be independent. But at least we can vote for the people that we would like to speak for us,\" Man said. \"Carrie Lam--is she listening? I don't think she is listening.\"", "Hong Kong lawmakers raise complaints over police brutality,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,19,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong lawmakers grilled the city's security secretary Wednesday over allegations of police brutality during protests over an extradition bill that eventually was suspended.The agenda for the meeting showed that pro-democracy members were planning to file a motion of no-confidence for Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the legislation, which sparked the demonstrations over recent weeks including a massive march on Sunday.The opposition lawmakers were wearing black with white ribbons pinned to their lapels. They put white chrysanthemums, another symbol of mourning, on their desks, and observed a few moments of silence in mourning for a protester who died in a fall last weekend.Security Secretary John Lee rejected suggestions that he should resign to take responsibility for police use of aggressive tactics, including beatings with steel batons and heavy use of tear gas. He also defended the decisions made on the scene.Pro-democracy lawmaker Gary Fan said that police encircled some protesters without warning and fired four rounds of tear gas. The demonstrators fled into a building, \"they ran for their lives,\" Fan said.\"The people didn't have anywhere to escape from the scene,\" he said. \"How can this be a minimal use of force?\"Lee reiterated Lam's insistence that the complaints against police would be handled through agencies established to handle such issues.Lam formally apologized Tuesday and said she was responsible for the extradition bill mess. The fact that she did not shed tears or bow in apology was front page news, with many in Hong Kong criticizing what they said was an apparent lack of contrition.The motion of no-confidence against Lam was likely to be voted down or boycotted by the majority pro-government legislators. Most did not show up for the questioning session over complaints against police.Critics of the extradition bill, which would allow some suspects to be extradited to stand trial in mainland courts, want Lam to permanently withdraw the legislation and to step down. They also are demanding the government guarantee that protest participants not be unfairly accused of rioting if they did not commit crimes.Beijing-appointed Lam would only say she would not revive the bill without certainty of its acceptance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 signaling that it has been shelved indefinitely.Many in Hong Kong fear a further weakening of this former British colony's legal autonomy, promised for 50 years after Beijing took over in 1997, at a time when Communist-ruled China is growing increasingly authoritarian.One concern is that the law might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.Lam has insisted the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.Samson Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, said the extradition bill is like a \"knife at the throat\" for many in Hong Kong.\"There's a lot of energy, emotion and passion and also anger,\" he said in an interview. \"It's a total mobilization of society.\"", "Hong Kong leader: Extradition bill unlikely to be revived,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's leader apologized Tuesday for an unpopular extradition bill that drew massive protests and indicated that it will not be revived during the current legislative session.But Chief Executive Carrie Lam did not formally retract the legislation. She also said she hopes to finish her term, shrugging away calls for her resignation.Lam acknowledged that it was unlikely she could win public trust in the bill, which would allow some suspects to face trial in mainland Chinese courts.\"In recognition of the anxiety and fears caused by the bill in the last few months, if we don't have confidence from the people we will not proceed with the legislative exercise again,\" Lam said.\"I will not proceed with this legislative exercise if these fears and anxieties could not be adequately addressed,\" she said.The bill ignited several massive protests, including a march by nearly 2 million people on Sunday and by as many as 1 million people a week earlier.Activists rejected Lam's earlier apologies for her handling of the legislation, which touched a nerve not easily soothed in a city anxious over the increasingly authoritarian Communist rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping.The uproar also has highlighted worries that Hong Kong is losing the special autonomous status China promised it when it took control from Britain in 1997.Scenes at the protests were similar to demonstrations in 2014, when people camped for weeks in the streets demanding direct elections of the city's chief executive, who is chosen by a pro-Beijing committee.One concern over the extradition bill is that it might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.Lam insists the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.So far, China has been excluded from Hong Kong's extradition agreements because of concerns over the independence of its courts and its human rights record.The vast majority of Hong Kong residents fled persecution, political chaos or poverty and famine on the Chinese mainland.

The seizure was the largest ever of stimulants in Japan.According to investigative sources, the group first came on the radar of law enforcement in November 2017 when a Minami-Izu resident reported a suspicious boat entering and leaving the harbor.That tip led to the start of a joint investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department, the Japan Coast Guard and Tokyo Customs.Surveillance confirmed that a suspicious boat was entering and leaving the harbor. A dozen or so suspicious individuals were placed on a surveillance list.Included in that list was one man who frequently traveled between Japan and Hong Kong. The man was followed whenever he entered Japan.Amid that ongoing investigation, law enforcement learned that the seven arrested flew separately to Japan from Hong Kong from early May, about one month before their eventual arrest. They were found to have looked over the harbor in Minami-Izu as well as frequented a members-only cruising club in Yokohama. The group anchored a boat registered in Aichi Prefecture at the club.Early on May 31, three men boarded the boat and departed from the Yokohama club. The following morning, the boat was spotted on a brief refueling stop at Hachijojima island, south of the Izu Peninsula.The boat was found to have then traveled about 600 kilometers farther south in the Pacific where those on board were spotted dropping something into the water and later retrieving it.On the evening of June 3, the boat entered the harbor at Minami-Izu, where police were waiting. They arrested two men who began unloading the cargo to a nearby car as well as two others on the boat.One man who fled from the boat as well as two others who served as lookouts were also arrested the next day.The ton of stimulants had been packed into 500 smaller bags containing 2 kilograms each.Police believe the stimulants were transported to the boat out at sea and are continuing their investigation into whether Hong Kong was the initial source of the smuggled stimulants.The seven arrested suspects have denied the allegations against them.(This article was written by Chihaya Inagaki and Yuko Kawasaki.)", "Beijing-backed candidate aims to lead casino hub of Macau,REUTERS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--The head of the legislature in Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, formally declared his candidacy on Tuesday in the race to run the Chinese-controlled territory for the next five years.The political leader Macau chooses in the elections set for Aug. 25 will work with mainland authorities and be instrumental in the award of new casino licenses, a process closely watched by industry officials and investors.Ho Iat Seng, the main contender in the elections to pick Macau's chief executive, is Beijing's favored candidate, industry experts say, and has won the public backing of the enclave's political elite.\"I will move to optimize people's livelihoods and diversified development, as well as deeply listening to society,\" the Macau-born Ho, who had previously said he would run, told a news conference broadcast on television.Macau's casino licenses for operators Sands China, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings, MGM China, Galaxy Entertainment and Melco Resorts expire in 2022.One of four potential candidates to announce his bid, Ho, who is in his 60s and has no direct ties to the casino industry, said he wanted to promote economic diversification and participation in national plans for the Greater Bay Area.He is Macau's only member of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament.There is no direct voting in the elections for chief executive, with the task entrusted to an election panel of 400 people selected for the job.", "ANALYSIS: China blinks on Hong Kong, but divide remains,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,18,2019": "BEIJING--The leader of China, it turns out, may not be all-powerful.Faced with huge and disruptive protests in Hong Kong, China blinked. The decision to shelve the legislation that sparked the demonstrations shows that limits still exist to how hard China can, or is willing, to push. It also exposed a fundamental contradiction in the \"one country, two systems\" framework that governs the semi-autonomous city.Chinese President Xi Jinping has cemented his hold on power since taking the helm in 2012. His government has expanded control over information, religion and other aspects of society. In Hong Kong, the local government has disqualified a pro-independence party, sent the leaders of a 2014 protest to prison and denied a visa renewal to an editor for Britain's Financial Times.Activists decried these moves as chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms, but residents largely went about their lives. Then the government, with China's backing, chipped too deeply, propelling hundreds of thousands, possibly millions in a city of 7.4 million people, into the streets.For Xi, it apparently tipped the scales in a balancing act between attempts to tighten Communist authority and stability in the international financial center, and wanting to keep Hong Kong from slipping out of Beijing's control--and even demanding independence.\"It is a sign that Xi Jinping's government is not totally impervious to pressure, despite the fact that he has consolidated so much power,\" said Ben Bland, an expert at the Lowy Institute in Australia and author of \"Generation HK: Seeking Identity in China's Shadow.\"It was in an atmosphere of uneasiness about China's intentions that Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, proposed changes to extradition laws that would allow Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to mainland China to face trial. The Chinese government supported the proposals, though it insisted that the idea was Lam's, not theirs.The idea ignited simmering concern about Chinese influence and Hong Kong's future. For many, the idea of being tried under the mainland legal system threw into question the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which the British returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 and that guarantees the city's right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years.It's a framework that has been tested repeatedly in the ensuing two decades and stems from an intractable problem in China's approach to Hong Kong. As China expert Kevin Carrico notes, the leader of Hong Kong is not elected democratically, as activists demand. Lam was chosen by a committee dominated by supporters of China's ruling Communist Party. She is beholden to the Chinese government, not the people of Hong Kong.So Lam persevered despite a massive protest on June 9, and then clashes between police and demonstrators outside the legislature on Wednesday. She finally gave in on Saturday, but not enough to stop another huge protest on Sunday whose turnout may have exceeded that of June 9.Carrico, a senior lecturer in Chinese Studies at Monash University in Australia, called the protests a testament to a failure of Xi's hard-line approach to Hong Kong. That includes a shift away from responding to or acknowledging the demands of protesters in Hong Kong, starting with the \"Umbrella Movement\" pro-democracy protests in 2014.That doesn't mean China will stop trying to control Hong Kong, as the balancing act continues.\"The Chinese government is determined to stop what it sees as the use of Two Systems to undermine the unity of One Country,\" Bland said. \"And Hong Kongers are clearly determined to fight for their freedoms.\"What is happening today in Hong Kong parallels what happened in 2003, when huge protests forced the government to drop a proposal to impose what opponents saw as a draconian national security law modeled on China's.Eventually, China's then-hand-picked leader resigned, but the fundamental issue remained, and protests returned in 2012, 2014 and this year.\"There's this constant cycle that is really a product of the way the chief executives of Hong Kong are elected,\" Carrico said.Xi and China may have beat a retreat, but the difference between what the two sides want suggests the pattern of government proposal and massive protest could well play out again in years to come.", "China stands by Hong Kong leader after days of street protests,REUTERS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--China redoubled its support for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Monday after days of protests against a planned extradition bill, and a source close to Lam said Beijing was unlikely to let her go even if she tried to resign.Lam's attempts to pass a bill that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China for trial triggered the biggest and most violent protests in decades in the former British colony, now under Chinese rule.As the crisis entered its second week, demonstrators and opposition politicians braved intermittent rain to gather near the government's offices and urge her to kill the bill and quit.The upheaval comes at a delicate time for Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is grappling with a deepening U.S. trade war, slowing economic growth and regional strategic tension.Hong Kong has been governed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula since its return to Chinese rule in 1997, enjoying freedoms not granted to the mainland, including an independent judiciary but short of a fully democratic vote.Many residents are increasingly unnerved by Beijing's tightening grip and what they see as the erosion of those freedoms. Many say changes to the rule of law could imperil Hong Kong's status as a global financial center.\"The Chinese government, the central government, has always fully affirmed the work of chief executive Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong government,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a news conference in Beijing.\"The central government will continue to firmly support the chief executive and the SAR government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governing in accordance with the law,\" he said, referring to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.Hong Kong police said late on Monday that 32 people had been arrested since Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters.Protest organizers said almost 2 million people--out of a population of around 7 million--turned out on Sunday to demand that Lam resign, in what is becoming the most significant challenge to China's relationship with the territory since 1997.The mass rally, which police said drew 338,000 participants at its peak, forced Lam to apologize for planning to push the bill through.On Monday, protesters near the government's offices blocked roads and urged Lam to withdraw the bill, release arrested students, drop the official description of a rally on Wednesday that involved clashes with the police as a riot, and step down.A senior Hong Kong official close to Lam told Reuters that Beijing was not likely to let her do so, even if she wanted to, saying \"it would create more problems than it solves, at all sorts of levels.\"Lam stopped short of explicitly killing the bill, but the official said the postponement meant it was effectively dead.Still, many in Hong Kong are unhappy to have faced the prospect of legislation that lawyers and judges say risks exposing people to the mercy of a mainland justice system plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detention.The bill would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living there or passing through.\"We cannot accept her apology, it doesn't remove all our threats,\" said social worker Brian Chau, one of several hundred protesters who stayed overnight in the Admiralty district around the government headquarters and legislature.In a coincidence of timing, 22-year-old Joshua Wong, the face of Hong Kong's push for full democracy, walked free from prison on Monday.\"I will join to fight against this evil law,\" said Wong, one of the leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" protests that blocked major roads for 79 days. \"I believe this is the time for her, Carrie Lam the liar, to step down.\"Two former post-colonial leaders, Tung Chee-Hwa and Leung Chun-ying, were forced to cut short their time in office amid controversies linked to policies that stoked fears of Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong's freedoms.The latest crisis escalated during Wong's five-week jail term for contempt of court. Until this month, the failure of the Umbrella protests to win concessions, coupled with prosecutions of at least 100 protesters, had discouraged many young people from going back out on the streets.But Lam's efforts to ram through the extradition bill galvanized opposition.On Monday, the benchmark share index climbed 0.4%, having risen more than 1% in early trade, outperforming gains in Asia ex-Japan and onshore China.Opposition politicians echoed marchers' calls for both Lam and the proposed law to go.\"Her government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,\" veteran Democratic Party legislator James To told government-funded broadcaster RTHK.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump was likely to raise the issue of Hong Kong human rights with China's Xi if they met at the G-20 summit in Japan next week.British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said she would raise the protests with Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, who is on a visit to London to boost economic and financial cooperation.", "Protesters demand that embattled Hong Kong leader resign,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,18,2019": "HONG KONG--Demonstrators in Hong Kong gathered Monday outside the office of the city's leader, demanding that she step down in the crisis over a highly unpopular extradition bill that has tested the durability of China's promises to respect the former British colony's quasi-autonomy.The mostly young protesters blocked a street near the city's waterfront as they stood outside the office of Chief Executive Carrie Lam chanting calls for her to cancel the proposed legislation.As night fell, protest leaders debated their next steps. Some wanted to set a deadline for a meeting with Lam. Others decided to head home.Nearly 2 million Hong Kong residents, young and old, joined a march on Sunday that lasted late into the night to express their frustrations with Lam and the extradition bill, backed by Beijing. Many stayed on afterward.Protesters blocked some downtown roads well into Monday morning, but gradually yielded to police requests to reopen roads, moving to areas near the city's government headquarters. The protest revived after Joshua Wong, a prominent activist leader, rallied the crowd after his release from prison later Monday.The activists have rejected apologies from Lam for her handling of the legislation, which would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. She announced that work on the bill would be suspended after large protests last week, but the legislation has touched a nerve not easily soothed in a city anxious over the increasingly authoritarian Communist rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\"We are very angry that Carrie Lam has not responded to the demands of all the protesters, but now is the time to talk about strategy, and talk about strategy is about how to make the whole struggle into a long-term struggle and not a day struggle, so if Carrie Lam does not respond to the demands by the protesters, people will come back and the struggle will continue,\" Lee Cheuk-yan, a former legislator and activist, said Monday.The uproar over the extradition bill highlights worries that the former British colony is losing the special autonomous status China promised it when it took control in 1997.On June 9, a week earlier, as many as 1 million people demonstrated to express their concern over Hong Kong's relations with mainland China.The scenes are similar to those in 2014, when protesters camped for weeks in the streets to protest rules that prevented the direct election of the city's chief executive.Wong, who was imprisoned for his role in the 2014 demonstrations and sit-ins, dubbed the \"Umbrella Movement,\" was released from prison on Monday after serving half of a two-month sentence on a contempt charge. He soon swapped his white shirt for one that was black--the color of this year's protests--and joined the fray.\"After the end of the Umbrella Movement we claimed we would be back. Finally five years later we did it,\" Wong said.\"It's lucky that Beijing and Carrie Lam transformed a whole generation of youngsters from normal citizens to dissidents. That's the price that Beijing must pay,\" Wong said.One concern over the extradition bill is that it might be used to send critics of Communist Party rule to the mainland to face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.It's seen as one of many steps chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms and legal autonomy.Lam insists the legislation is needed for Hong Kong to uphold justice, meet its international obligations and not become a magnet for fugitives. It would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.So far, China has been excluded from Hong Kong's extradition agreements because of concerns over the judicial independence of its courts and its human rights record.The vast majority of Hong Kong residents fled persecution, political chaos or famine in the Chinese mainland. They value stability and but also cherish freedoms of dissent and legal protections not allowed Chinese living across the border.Many Hong Kong residents also were angered over the police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government's headquarters during demonstrations on Wednesday, and over Lam's decision to call the clashes a riot. That worsens the potential legal consequences for those involved.The city's police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-chung, said late Monday that only those found to have committed violent acts would be charged with rioting, in an apparent attempt to appease the anger.Although he also described the fracas as a riot, he said only five of 15 arrested people were accused of rioting, which can result in a prison term of up to 10 years. Another 17 people were arrested in the vicinity on lesser charges, he said.The protesters have mainly focused their ire toward Lam, who has little choice but to carry through dictates issued by Beijing. She has sidestepped questions over whether she should quit and also defended how the police dealt with last week's clashes.Many here believe Hong Kong's legal autonomy has been significantly diminished despite Beijing's insistence that it is still honoring its promise, dubbed \"one country, two systems,\" that the territory can retain its own social, legal and political system for 50 years after the handover from Britain in 1997.Prosecutions of activists, detentions without trial of five Hong Kong book publishers and the illegal seizure in Hong Kong by mainland agents of at least one mainland businessman are among moves in recent years that have unnerved many in the city of 7 million.", "With sense of unease, Taiwan rallies behind Hongkongers,By HIDESHI NISHIMOTO/ Correspondent,June,17,2019": "TAIPEI--Concerns are growing here that the turmoil Hong Kong has been thrown into over controversial extradition legislation may be a reflection of things to come.Protesters hit the streets here on June 16 in an expression of solidarity with millions of marchers who filled the streets of Hong Kong the same day in large-scale protests now in their second week.Passage of the extradition legislation would allow authorities to send some suspects to China, where opponents worry they may face torture and unfair trials.Several hundred protesters gathered in front of the Legislative Yuan building in Taipei, reflecting a deepened concern among Taiwanese that \"today's Hong Kong will be tomorrow's Taiwan,\" a key phrase of the rally.Office worker Liu Bo-jing, 30, who attended the protest with his friends, said: \"China's next target is Taiwan. I worry about being caught up in this.\"The slogan originates in a 2014 \"Sunflower Student Movement\" in Taiwan, during which activists occupied the Legislative Yuan and government facilities in protest of the Ma Ying-jeou government, led by the China-friendly Kuomintang (Nationalist Party).Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a speech in January that he would not rule out the use of force for reunification with Taiwan and proposed a \"one country, two systems\" principle to the region.With presidential elections set for next January in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen said on June 10, the second day of protests in Hong Kong, \"If we were to accept such a system, we would lose our freedom, democracy and human rights.\"Tsai, who is seeking to stay in office, has made efforts to expand support by using such fundamental concerns among Taiwanese as a springboard.Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, who is seen as a strong candidate of the opposition Kuomintang, has called for improved ties with China. He recently met in March with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.When asked by Taiwan media about the crisis in Hong Kong, Han responded simply, \"I don't know,\" generating criticism from Taiwan citizens.Under fire in Hong Kong, Lam suspended efforts to enact the extradition bill on June 15.", "Hong Kong rich start moving assets offshore as fears rise,REUTERS,June,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore as concern deepens over a local government plan to allow extraditions of suspects to face trial in China for the first time, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with such transactions.One tycoon, who considers himself potentially politically exposed, has started shifting more than $100 million (10.8 billion yen) from a local Citibank account to a Citibank account in Singapore, according to an adviser involved in the transactions.\"It's started. We're hearing others are doing it, too, but no-one is going to go on parade that they are leaving,\" the adviser said. \"The fear is that the bar is coming right down on Beijing's ability to get your assets in Hong Kong. Singapore is the favored destination.\"Hong Kong and Singapore compete fiercely to be considered Asia's premier financial center. The riches held by Hong Kong's tycoons have until now made the city the larger base for private wealth, boasting 853 individuals worth more than $100 million--just over double the number in Singapore--according to a 2018 report from Credit Suisse.The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, has sparked unusually broad concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong's international financial status. Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, has stood by the bill, saying it is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said the courts would safeguard human rights.Protests and violence forced an initial legislative debate to be shelved last Wednesday and it is unclear when they would resume to pass the bill.Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school, told Reuters that it was understandable that some Hong Kong residents might be considering moving assets out of the city given the little-noticed financial reach of the bill.If the bill becomes law, it will be possible for mainland Chinese courts to request Hong Kong courts to freeze and confiscate assets related to crimes committed on the mainland, beyond an existing provision covering the proceeds of drug offenses. \"This has been largely overlooked in the public debate but it is really a significant part of the proposed amendments,\" Young said. \"It may not have been overlooked, of course, by the tycoons and those giving them legal advice.\"The head of the private banking operations of an international bank in Hong Kong, who declined to be named, said clients have been moving money out of Hong Kong to Singapore. \"These aren't mainland Chinese clients who might be politically exposed, but wealthy Hong Kong clients,\" the banker said. \"The situation in Hong Kong is out of control. They can't believe that Carrie Lam or Beijing leaders are so stupid that they don't realize the economic damage from this.\"A Hong Kong government spokesman did not directly address Reuters' questions over capital flight, but said Hong Kong's \"world class financial infrastructure\" and open, international market had a regulatory regime \"completely compatible with that of overseas markets.\"The amendments seek to simplify case-by-case extraditions to jurisdictions, including mainland China, beyond the 20 with which Hong Kong already has extradition treaties.As well as removing an explicit block on extraditions to mainland China in the current Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the amendments also remove the restrictions on the mainland from the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance, known as the MLAO.According to a recent Hong Kong Bar Association study, the MLAO allows foreign jurisdictions to ask Hong Kong authorities to gather evidence for use outside the city \"and to render other forms of assistance, such as freezing and confiscating the assets of persons wanted for crimes in other jurisdictions.\"Search, seizure and confiscation can involve cases with a penalty of two years in prison or more, compared with the threshold of seven years for extraditions under the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the submission notes. Requests can also be made at the investigative rather than prosecution stage.The association notes that the mutual legal assistance amendments would \"significantly strengthen the impact of the amended Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in relation to criminal prosecutions on the mainland.\"The Hong Kong government spokesman noted that any external confiscation order had to be registered in a Hong Kong court and could be challenged. It had to meet a \"double criminality\" standard, whereby it had to be based on conduct that was also a crime in Hong Kong.\"The rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people and foreigners in Hong Kong, including their assets, are fully protected by the Basic Law,\" the spokesman added, referring to Hong Kong's mini-Constitution.Prominent commercial lawyer Kevin Yam said he was aware of high net-worth Hong Kong figures taking steps to move assets to Singapore as they matured or market conditions proved favorable.\"At this point I would say it is a steady trickle rather than stampede but is most definitely happening,\" he said.Three other private bankers said they had received inquiries from clients about the impact of the bill, but had not yet seen the funds move.Yam said few expected the bill to be widely exploited by Beijing overnight if passed, but it was creating a climate of deep unease, with the fear it could be used more liberally in coming years.\"It is great for Singapore,\" he said. \"And such an own goal for Hong Kong.\"", "Japan Display loses Taiwanese partner in bailout plan,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,June,17,2019": "Japan Display Inc.

Outside the walls is a wasteland swarming with giant humanoid creatures called Titans that devour people.When the walls are finally broken, people band together to fight back against the gigantic monsters.In 2014, Hong Kong's youth apparently found an intriguing analogy between them and the embattled humans in the manga series.Some of the young people who took part in the pro-democracy demonstrations that year against Chinese efforts to tighten control over the former British colony referred to episodes of the manga.Tens of thousands of people joined the Umbrella Movement protests, using umbrellas to shield themselves against police tear gas and pepper spray, and occupying major roads for almost three months.Five years later, Hong Kong is being roiled again by large-scale, spirited demonstrations, described as a reincarnation of the movement.This time, people in the city are fighting the so-called fugitives bill, designed to enable authorities to extradite criminal suspects to China.Critics fear Beijing could use the proposed legislation to seize anyone in the territory at will and whisk them off to China on trumped-up charges for trial in the country's Communist Party-controlled courts.For anyone who has read \u00e2\u0080\u009cAttack on Titan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this prospect is likely to conjure up images of giants dragging humans off to the wasteland they inhabit.Under the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d governance model, freedom of speech is guaranteed in Hong Kong, where the judiciary is supposed to be independent of politics.But the bill is threatening to break one of the walls that protects freedom in Hong Kong.For the Chinese authorities, the walls are nothing but obstacles to their political agenda. But they can also serve as mirrors that reflect the absurdities of the dictatorship in China.The wave of protests is putting huge pressure on Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government.

Standing by were a smattering of uniformed police without riot gear, in contrast to their appearance during recent skirmishes with protesters.", "Hong Kong police begin to clear streets of protesters,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police and protesters faced off Monday as authorities began trying to clear the streets of a few hundred who remained near the city government headquarters after massive demonstrations that stretched deep into the night before.The police asked for cooperation in clearing the road but said the protesters could stay on the sidewalks. Protesters, many in masks and other gear to guard against possible use of tear gas, responded with chants, some kneeling in front of the officers. The move came after activists rejected an apology from the city's top leader for her handling of legislation that has stoked fears of expanding control from Beijing in this former British colony.Groups of police, most in normal uniforms not riot gear, sought to clear the roads of metal and plastic barricades to enable traffic to pass through. In some places, the protesters quickly moved to put them back to block traffic.Hundreds of protesters were sitting or lying along a main road through downtown, but they were scattered over a relatively wide area.Activists called on Hong Kong residents to boycott classes and work, though it was unclear how many might heed that call.Nearly 2 million of the city's 7 million people turned out on Sunday, according to estimates by protest organizers. Police said 338,000 were counted on the designated protest route in the \"peak period\" of the march. A week earlier as many as 1 million people demonstrated to voice their concern over Hong Kong's relations with mainland China in one of the toughest tests of the territory's special status since Beijing took control in a 1997 handover.The scenes were similar to those seen nearly five years earlier, when protesters camped for weeks in the streets to protest rules that prevented the direct election of the city's chief executive, the top local official.One of the activists arrested after those demonstrations, Joshua Wong, was due to be released from prison Monday. He served half of a two-month jail sentence for contempt.After daybreak Monday, police announced that they want to clear the streets. Soon after, police lined up several officers deep and faced off against several hundred demonstrators on a street in central Hong Kong.The night before, as protesters reached the march's end thousands gathered outside the city government headquarters and the office of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who on Saturday suspended her effort to force passage of the bill.Hong Kong residents worry that allowing some suspects to be sent for trial in mainland China would be another of many steps chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms and legal autonomy. One concern is that the law might be used to send criminal suspects to China to potentially face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.The protesters are demanding that Lam scrap the proposal for good and that she step down.Protesters are also angered over the forceful tactics by police use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government's headquarters to quell unrest during demonstrations on Wednesday, and over Lam's decision to call the clashes a riot. That worsens the potential legal consequences for those involved.In a statement issued late Sunday, Lam noted the demonstrations and said the government \"understands that these views have been made out of love and care for Hong Kong.\"\"The chief executive apologizes to the people of Hong Kong for this and pledges to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public,\" it said.Not enough, said the pro-democracy activists.\"This is a total insult to and fooling the people who took to the street!\" the Civil Human Rights Front said in a statement.Protesters have mainly focused their anger on Lam, who had little choice but to carry through dictates issued by Beijing, where President Xi Jinping has enforced increasingly authoritarian rule. But some were skeptical that having Lam step down would help.\"It doesn't really matter because the next one would be just as evil,\" said Kayley Fung, 27.Many here believe Hong Kong's legal autonomy has been significantly diminished despite Beijing's insistence that it is still honoring its promise, dubbed \"one country, two systems,\" that the territory can retain its own social, legal and political system for 50 years after the handover in 1997.After Lam announced she was suspending the legislation to avoid more violence and allow additional debate, Chinese government officials issued multiple statements backing that decision. Lam, however, made clear she was not withdrawing it.She has sidestepped questions over whether she should quit and also defended how the police dealt with last week's clashes with demonstrators.Lam insists the extradition legislation is needed if Hong Kong is to uphold justice, meet its international obligations and not become a magnet for fugitives. The proposed bill would expand the scope of criminal suspect transfers to include Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.So far, China has been excluded from Hong Kong's extradition agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record.Prosecutions of activists, detentions without trial of five Hong Kong book publishers and the illegal seizure in Hong Kong by mainland agents of at least one mainland businessman are among moves in recent years that have unnerved many in the city of 7 million.", "Massive protests draw apology from Hong Kong leadership,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong citizens marched for hours Sunday in a massive protest that drew a late-in-the-day apology from the city's top leader for her handling of legislation that has stoked fears of expanding control from Beijing in this former British colony.Nearly 2 million of the city's 7 million people turned out, according to estimates by protest organizers. Police said 338,000 were counted on the designated protest route in the \"peak period\" of the march. A week earlier as many as 1 million people demonstrated to voice their concern over Hong Kong's relations with mainland China in one of the toughest tests of the territory's special status since Beijing took control in a 1997 handover.Well after dark, crowds gathered outside the police headquarters and Chief Executive Carrie Lam's office. On Saturday Lam suspended her effort to force passage of the bill, which would allow some suspects to be sent for trial in mainland China.The move did not appease Hong Kong residents who see it as one of many steps chipping away at Hong Kong's freedoms and legal autonomy. Opponents worry the law could be used to send criminal suspects to China to potentially face vague political charges, possible torture and unfair trials.Protesters are also angered over the forceful tactics by police in quelling unrest at a demonstration on Wednesday.Periodically, the shouts of the protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the police headquarters would crescendo into a roar that reverberated through the narrow concrete canyons of the red-light district of Wanchai.Smaller crowds stood chanting outside Lam's office building.In a statement issued late Sunday, Lam noted the demonstrations and said the government \"understands that these views have been made out of love and care for Hong Kong.\"\"The chief executive apologizes to the people of Hong Kong for this and pledges to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public,\" it said.Not enough, said the pro-democracy activists.\"This is a total insult to and fooling the people who took to the street!\" the Civil Human Rights Front said in a statement.The marchers want Lam to scrap the extradition bill, which is supported by the communist leadership in Beijing, and to resign.The crowds filled a wide thoroughfare and side streets paralleling the waterfront of Victoria Harbor as tourists and shoppers who drive much of the Asian financial hub's economy looked on.Some participants were skeptical over whether having Lam step down would help.\"It doesn't really matter because the next one would be just as evil,\" said Kayley Fung, 27.At the march's end, hundreds sat wearily around the government headquarters. Some were singing, some listening to speeches. Some were just resting.\"There isn't really a plan. It's like playing a chess game,\" said a man who gave only his first name, Mitchel, perhaps fearing trouble with the authorities.Protesters have mainly focused their anger on Lam, who had little choice but to carry through dictates issued by Beijing, where President Xi Jinping has enforced increasingly authoritarian rule.Many here believe Hong Kong's legal autonomy has been significantly diminished despite Beijing's insistence that it is still honoring its promise, dubbed \"one country, two systems,\" that the territory can retain its own social, legal and political system for 50 years after the handover.The rally drew marchers both young and old, some pushing strollers or carrying slumbering infants. Few wore face masks or seemed to be trying to hide their identities, in contrast with demonstrations Wednesday, when participants expressed worries over possible retribution from the authorities.Protesters also are angry over the way police used tear gas, rubber bullets and other forceful measures as demonstrators broke through barricades outside the city government's headquarters in that smaller but more aggressive protest.The police presence on Sunday was considerably more relaxed, with officers deployed mainly to direct traffic as the protesters wound their way through Hong Kong's commercial center from a sprawling downtown park to government headquarters.Farther down the parade route, mourners lined up to lay flowers and pay respects at a makeshift memorial for a man who fell to his death Saturday after hanging a protest banner that read in part, \"Make Love, No Shoot\" and \"No Extradition to China.\"The man slipped from the grasp of rescuers after clinging for a time to scaffolding outside a shopping mall. He missed a large cushion set up to capture him and was declared dead at a nearby hospital.Many protesters wore ribbons on their shirts and carried placards showing protesters who had been beaten bloody last week.Pro-democracy activists were calling for a general strike on Monday despite Lam's decision to suspend work on the legislation. Some labor unions, teachers' associations and other groups were planning boycotts of work and classes, demanding the Lam administration retire the proposed amendments and not bring them up again for passage at a later stage.\"We encourage all the public to carry on the campaign,\" said Bonnie Leung, a leader of the pro-democracy group Civil Human Rights Front. \"If any new violence takes place, it will be the responsibility of the police.\"The Communist Party-ruled mainland took control in 1997 with a promise not to interfere with the city's civil liberties and courts.

Everything depends on the attitudes of the leaders in Beijing.\"After Lam announced she was suspending the legislation to avoid more violence and allow additional debate, Chinese government officials issued multiple statements backing that decision.

On Saturday, she appeared to be fighting for her political life as she sought to explain her decision to push through unpopular legislation that would make it easier to extradite suspects to communist-ruled mainland China, which took control of the territory in a 1997 handover.A key reason for Lam's vulnerability is that she was not directly elected by the territory's people, but rather ushered into office in 2017 by the vote of a 1,194-member committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites--despite being far less popular than her main rival.She now finds herself caught between a public that never truly backed her, and leaders in Beijing who want her to push through unpopular measures seen to be eroding Western-style economic, social and cultural freedoms that Beijing promised to respect for at least 50 years after it took back control from Britain.Lam, 62, has a reputation as an efficient and pragmatic administrator. But she was unpopular with Hong Kongers even before she took office because she was seen as a proxy for Beijing who was out of touch with ordinary people.She said Saturday that she was shelving the extradition bill to avoid further social turmoil following a protest march that drew hundreds of thousands of people on June 9 and violent clashes on Wednesday where police used tear gas, rubber bullets and other tactics, angering the public further.Lam's insistence that she had the full backing of China's central government in taking her decision likely rang as tone-deaf given skepticism over the communist leadership's motives, especially after a deadly crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square three decades ago.\"They understand, they have confidence in my judgment and they support me,\" Lam told reporters, while also saying the legislation was still needed.Hours later, Bonny Leung, a leader with a pro-democracy alliance, accused Lam of \"ignorance and arrogance.\" She and other activists urged Hong Kong citizens to turn out en-masse for a march Sunday to demand the full withdrawal of the extradition bill, an apology for the aggressive police tactics and Lam's resignation as chief executive.Few anticipated that Lam would become embroiled in such friction when she took over from her predecessor Leung Chun-ying, a highly polarizing former policeman who stepped down as chief executive in 2017, citing family reasons.Lam may eventually, after a face-saving interval, also end up stepping aside, analysts said. That would allow time for Beijing to decide upon a successor that the leadership considers both competent and politically reliable.\"They may not fire her immediately, but her chances for a second term are totally gone now and they may find a reason to let her go without losing much face because now she is hated by everybody in Hong Kong and her administration has become quite ungovernable,\" said Willy Lam, a veteran political observer.Carrie Lam is Hong Kong's first female leader and its fourth since Britain ended its colonial rule in 1997. While the Chinese government in Beijing has condemned foreign criticism of the protests over the extradition bill as meddling in the country's internal affairs, they've largely remained aloof from the controversy in Hong Kong, preferring to let Lam take the heat or even make her a scapegoat, according to some analysts.China's ambassador to Britain told the BBC the push to fast-track the extradition bill was entirely Lam's idea.Unlike many in the top ranks of Hong Kong's leadership, Lam comes from a humble background. She grew up in the downtown Wanchai district, the fourth of five children. She attended a Catholic girls school, the University of Hong Kong and later Cambridge University.She is married to a mathematician and has two sons. They are British citizens, but Lam is not.Much of the unhappiness with Lam and her administration predates her appointment as chief executive. Protests in 2014 over rules Beijing imposed for choosing members of the election committee that helps select the chief executive paralyzed parts of the city for weeks.The protests, dubbed the Umbrella Movement, highlighted Hong Kong aspirations for greater, rather than less democracy.On taking office, Lam pledged to focus on issues such as housing, education and health care. In pushing for the extradition bill, she ignited public frustrations over increasing control by Beijing.In speaking to reporters on Saturday, Lam insisted she only wants what's good for Hong Kong.\"We have not done a good enough job to convince the people of Hong Kong,\" she said. \"Give us another chance.\"", "Hong Kong leader suspends\u00e3\u0080\u0080extradition bill after protests,REUTERS,June,15,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday delayed indefinitely a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China, in a dramatic retreat after widespread anger over the bill sparked the biggest street protests in three decades.The extradition bill, which would cover Hong Kong's 7 million residents as well as foreign and Chinese nationals in the city, was seen by many as a threat to the rule of law in the former British colony.Around a million people marched through Hong Kong last Sunday to oppose the bill, according to protest organizers, the largest since protests in the city against the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations centered around Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.Demonstrations continued through the week and were met with tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets from police, plunging the city into turmoil and piling heavy pressure on Lam.\"After repeated internal deliberations over the last two days, I now announce that the government has decided to suspend the legislative amendment exercise, restart our communication with all sectors of society, do more explanation work and listen to different views of society,\" Lam told a news conference.She said there was no deadline, effectively suspending the process indefinitely.The about-face was one of the most significant political turnarounds under public pressure by the Hong Kong government since Britain returned the territory to China in 1997, and it threw into question Lam's ability to continue to lead the city.But it potentially alleviated an unwanted headache for the leadership in Beijing, which is grappling with a slowing economy and a simmering trade war with the United States.Asked repeatedly if she would step down, Lam avoided directly answering and appealed to the public to \"give us another chance\". She said she had been a civil servant for decades and still had work she wanted to do.The extradition bill deliberations started in February and Lam had pushed to have it passed by July. Backing down was unthinkable last week when the law's passage seemed inevitable as Lam remained defiant.But the protests changed the equation.Cracks began to appear on Friday in the support base for the bill with several pro-Beijing politicians and a senior adviser to Lam saying discussion of the bill should be postponed for the time being.Lam had not appeared in public or commented since Wednesday. She met pro-Beijing lawmakers to explain her pending announcement earlier on Saturday.Sing Tao newspaper reported that China's top official overseeing Hong Kong policy, Vice Premier Han Zheng, met Lam in Shenzhen in recent days.Lam declined to confirm whether or not the meeting had happened, but took ownership for the decision to suspend the bill and said she had support from the central government.She stopped short of apologizing, saying she felt \"deep sorrow and regret that the deficiencies in our work and various other factors have stirred up substantial controversies and disputes in society\".Beyond the public outcry, the extradition bill had spooked some of Hong Kong's tycoons into starting to move their personal wealth offshore, according to financial advisers, bankers and lawyers familiar with the details.And senior police officers have said Lam's refusal to heed public opinion was sowing resentment in the force, which was already battered by accusations of police brutality during the 2014 pro-democracy \"Umbrella\" civil disobedience movement.Michael Tien, a member of Hong Kong's legislature and a deputy to China's national parliament, said a total withdrawal of the bill would not be possible.\"The amendment is supported by the central government, so I think a withdrawal would send a political message that the central government is wrong. This would not happen under 'one country, two systems',\" he told Reuters, referring to the model under which Hong Kong enjoys semi-autonomy.Organisers of last Sunday's protest march are planning another march this Sunday.In addition to calling for the bill to be completely dropped, they would also be pushing for accountability of the police for the way protests have been handled.Lam has said the extradition law is necessary to prevent criminals using Hong Kong as a place to hide and that human rights will be protected by the city's court which will decide on the extraditions on a case-by-case basis.Critics, including leading lawyers and rights groups, note that China's justice system is controlled by the Communist Party, and marked by torture and forced confessions, arbitrary detention and poor access to lawyers.Hong Kong is governed by China under a \"one country, two systems\" deal that guarantees it special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary.Many accuse Beijing of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialised in works critical of Chinese leaders.The Chinese government has denied that it has overreached in Hong Kong.", "Chinese state media urges retribution after UBS economist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098insult\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,June,15,2019": "BEIJING--Those who insult Chinese people should pay the price in order to deter would-be offenders from following suit, Chinese state media said in a sharply worded commentary, after remarks by a UBS economist about pigs sparked an outcry in China.Paul Donovan, global chief economist of UBS's wealth management business, said in a podcast on Wednesday that consumer prices in China had risen after an outbreak of African swine fever killed a vast number of pigs and cut pork supplies.\"Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China,\" Donovan said in comments that some interpreted as referring to people, not livestock.His comments caused a furor in Chinese social media and even prompted one Chinese firm to suspend all dealings with Switzerland's largest bank.UBS apologized for any misunderstanding caused by Donovan's comments and put the economist on leave. Donovan also said he was sorry.\"Whether or not Donovan was fired is still unknown, but those who insult Chinese people must pay the price,\" the People's Daily, the newspaper of China's Communist Party, said in a commentary published late on Friday.\"Otherwise, relapses will be inevitable, and would-be offenders will be incentivized to do the same,\" the newspaper warned.Many tried to explain it away by saying Chinese people are not native English speakers and have misunderstood, said Hao Hong, head of research at Bank of Communications International in Hong Kong and among the first in the Chinese financial community to call out Donovan for his comments.\"But you don't need to be a native speaker to understand the derogatory connection between the word 'pig' and a culture,\" Hong, wrote in a post on his personal WeChat account.Donovan did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.The stakes are high for foreign companies like UBS looking to expand their presence in China as the world's second-largest economy further opens up its financial sector.In December last year, UBS became the first foreign bank in China to get official approval to acquire a controlling stake in its local securities joint venture.UBS has said it was enhancing its \"internal processes\" to avoid any recurrence of such an incident and remains \"fully committed to investing in China\".The Swiss bank is not the first to trip over cultural issues in China.Last year, Italian luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana caused an uproar after one of its advertisements showed a model of East Asian ancestry struggling to eat pizza with chopsticks.\"Whenever Chinese nationals respond to insults by foreigners, some people would quickly criticise Chinese people for having 'hearts of glass',\" the People's Daily wrote.\"Even some compatriots feel that any Chinese retaliation is like making a mountain out of a molehill.

I would like my friends in the demonstration in Hong Kong to be inspired by what is happening here.\"Motoyama has been in contact with young people in Hong Kong who supported the pro-democracy protest movement known as the \"Umbrella Revolution,\" which called for the implementation of democratic elections in the region.", "Taiwan leader Tsai gets party nod to run for re-election,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,14,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, a thorn in the side of China's government because of her pro-independence views, sewed up the ruling party's nomination Thursday to seek a second four-year term after a tense primary race.She outperformed her opponent in three days of opinion polling, setting herself up to be named as the Democratic Progressive Party's candidate in the January 2020 election.Tsai's tough stance against Chinese pressure to reunite with the mainland has driven up once-sagging approval ratings. Her nomination is all but sure to be ratified by the party next week.She has sought public favor by strengthening the military and cultivating ties with the United States, said Huang Kwei-bo, vice dean of the international affairs college at National Chengchi University.\"Tsai Ing-wen is continuously saying 'I'm going to protect Taiwan and stand up for autonomy and make the most of foreign relations,'\" he said.Her government has helped break ground on a submarine manufacturing site, accepted high-level visits from the United States and received American military support, including seven U.S. Navy ship passages over the past year through the strait dividing China from Taiwan.China criticizes the high-level visits and the naval ship passages.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in January that the two sides should be ruled like Hong Kong, which is grappling with mass street protests targeting Chinese control. Hong Kong is part of China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework that gives the territory some local autonomy.More than 80 percent of Taiwanese said in a government survey in January that they prefer self-rule over merging with China.\"What Taiwanese feel most deeply about this is that 'one-country, two systems' is not viable and not acceptable for a democratic Taiwan,\" Tsai told reporters Thursday afternoon after her secretary general met with Hong Kong students at the presidential office.The Democratic Progressive Party, which embraces more autonomy for Taiwan instead of a tie-up with China, announced that Tsai had defeated her only challenger, former Premier William Lai, in three days of opinion polling.Tsai received approval from 35.7 percent of the roughly 15,000 people polled against Lai's 27.5 percent, party Chairman Cho Jung-tai said.In response to her victory, Tsai called later Thursday for \"uniting all our power that can be united\" to \"defend Taiwan.\"Tsai will go up against a candidate from the opposition Nationalist Party, which advocates closer relations with Beijing.Possible Nationalist candidates include Terry Gou, chairman of the world's largest consumer electronics assembler, Foxconn Technology, and Han Kuo-yu, the populist mayor of southern port city Kaohsiung.Tsai fell below 30 percent in public opinion polls last year as Taiwanese worried about inaction toward China as well as domestic economic issues such as jobs and housing prices.Tsai upsets Beijing because she rejects its dialogue condition that both sides belong to a single China, and seeks a closer relationship with the United States. China has reacted by picking off five nations that had diplomatic ties with Taiwan, scaling back Taiwan-bound group tourism and flying military aircraft near the island.\"Looking at the Taiwan election from China's point of view, another term for Tsai would be a disaster,\" said Denny Roy, senior fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu.China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the Chinese civil war, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost and rebased their government in Taiwan. The two sides have been ruled separately for seven decades.", "Hong Kong protesters scuffle with police, government offices shut,REUTERS,June,14,2019": "HONG KONG--Scuffles broke out between demonstrators and police in Hong Kong on Thursday as hundreds of people kept up a protest against a planned extradition law with mainland China, a day after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up big crowds.Protests around the city's legislature on Wednesday forced the postponement of debate on the extradition bill, which many people in Hong Kong fear will undermine freedoms and confidence in the commercial hub.Hong Kong's China-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the violence and urged a swift restoration of order but has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite the reservations about it, including within the business community.The number of protesters milling about outside the legislature in the financial district fell overnight but rose again through the day on Thursday to about 1,000 at one stage.They expect the legislature, which has a majority of pro-Beijing members, will try to hold the debate at some stage, though it issued a notice saying there would be no session on Thursday.\"We will be back when, and if, it comes back for discussion again,\" said protester Stephen Chan, a 20-year-old university student.\"We just want to preserve our energy now.\"Earlier, some protesters tried to stop police from removing their supplies of face masks and food and scuffles broke out.Police with helmets and shields blocked overhead walkways and plainclothes officers checked commuters' identity cards.A clean-up got underway to remove debris like broken umbrellas, helmets, plastic water bottles and barricades from the streets after the previous day's clashes. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray on Wednesday in a series of skirmishes to clear demonstrators from the legislature.Officials said 72 people were admitted to hospitals.Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said what began as a peaceful gathering on Wednesday had degenerated into a riot with protesters \"acting violently in an organized manner.\"Police arrested 11 people and fired about 150 tear gas canisters at the crowd. The city's hospital authority said a total of 81 people were injured in the protests. 22 police were injured according to Lo.Police also later arrested two students at the University of Hong Kong after a raid on a student hall of residence, according to an official at the university. The police gave no immediate response to Reuters inquiries on what charges the students face.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Chinese government \"strongly condemns the violent behavior and we support the (Hong Kong) government in dealing with it according to law.\"In the United States, senior congressional lawmakers from both parties responded to the crisis by introducing legislation that would require the U.S. government to provide an annual justification for the continuation of special business and trade privileges afforded to Hong Kong.\"If the extradition bill moves forward and Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s autonomy and democratic institutions continue to erode due to interference from the Chinese government, the Congress has no choice but to reassess whether Hong Kong can receive preferential economic and trade benefits under U.S. law,\" Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, one of 13 co-sponsors of the proposed legislation, said in a statement.The U.S. State Department said on Monday it was gravely concerned about the proposed amendments to the extradition laws, warning they could jeopardize Hong Kong's special status.Authorities shut government offices in the financial district, which is overlooked by the towers of some of Asia's biggest firms and hotel chains, for the rest of the week after some of the worst violence in Hong Kong in decades.Hong Kong's benchmark stock exchange slid as much as 1.5% on Thursday before closing down 0.1%, extending losses from the previous day.Most roads in the business district were open on Thursday but some shops and offices were closed and banks, including Standard Chartered, Bank of China and DBS, said they had suspended branch services in the area.Wednesday saw the third night of violence since a protest on Sunday drew what organizers said was more than a million people for the biggest street demonstration since the 1997 handover of the former British colony back to Chinese rule.The handover included a deal to preserve special autonomy, but many in Hong Kong accuse China of extensive meddling since then, including obstruction of democratic reforms and interference in local elections.The extradition bill, which will cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or travelling through the city, has sparked concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong's international financial status.Beijing rejects accusations of meddling and Chinese state media said this week \"foreign forces\" were trying to damage China by creating chaos over the bill.The English-language China Daily said the \"lawlessness\" would hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its law.Lam and her officials say the law is necessary to plug loopholes that allow criminals wanted on the mainland to use the city as a haven. She has said the courts would provide human rights safeguards.The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized Sunday's huge march, said it was planning another demonstration for Sunday.Opponents of the bill, including lawyers and rights groups, say China's justice system is marked by torture and forced confessions and arbitrary detention.Democratic city legislators condemned Lam and what they said was heavy-handed police action.\"We are not a haven for criminals, but we have become a haven of violent police. Firing at our children? None of the former chief executives dared to do that,\" said legislator Fernando Cheung.\"But 'mother Carrie Lam' did it. What kind of mother is she?\"Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not accept any extradition requests from Hong Kong under the proposed law. The self-ruled island also issued a travel alert.Hong Kong's Tourism Board called off a dragon boat carnival this weekend while the city's bar association expressed concern over video footage of police using force against largely unarmed protesters.Amnesty International and domestic rights groups condemned what they said was excessive force by the police, while a spokeswoman for the U.N. Human Rights Office in Geneva said it was following the situation closely.Diplomatic pressure was also building after leaders such as British Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the protests.The European Union said it shared many concerns over the proposed extradition reform and urged public consultation.", "China cyberattack hits messaging app during HK protest,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,13,2019": "BEIJING--An encrypted messaging app said Thursday that it was hit by a powerful cyberattack from China as a major protest unfolded in Hong Kong.The attack on the Telegram app, which slowed connectivity but did not compromise user data, came as thousands surrounded Hong Kong government headquarters on Wednesday to protest legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China to stand trial. They protesters were forcibly dispersed by police using tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that most of the attackers had IP addresses from China.\"Historically, all state actor-sized (attacks) we experienced coincided in time with protests in Hong Kong,\" Durov said. \"This case was not an exception.\"Activists in both Hong Kong and mainland China often use Telegram to organize protests in hopes the encryption will allow them to evade the government surveillance of Chinese social networking apps such as WeChat.Whereas WeChat users reported this week that photos of the protests could not be viewed, apps like Telegram offer more privacy and independence. Telegram is blocked in mainland China, but users can access it using software to circumvent the firewall, which also blocks apps and websites ranging from Facebook to The New York Times.Encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram say that messages sent on their systems cannot be intercepted by third parties during the delivery from sender to recipient. \"We can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression,\" Telegram says on its website.Telegram said that the latest attack was a distributed denial of service in which \"your servers get GADZILLIONS of garbage requests which stop them from processing legitimate requests.\"The messaging app said on Wednesday evening that the system had stabilized.The protest in Hong Kong forced the legislature to cancel its sessions Wednesday and Thursday, putting off debate on the extradition legislation.Opponents say the bill would severely compromise their freedoms and erode Hong Kong's legal independence. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam maintains the legislation is necessary and would have safeguards to ensure human rights are protected.Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, enjoys greater freedoms than mainland China under a \"one country, two systems\" framework put in place when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. Hong Kong residents can freely surf the Internet and participate in public protests, unlike in the mainland.The U.S. government has complained for years about data breaches by China to steal high-tech information and other trade secrets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a key factor in the current trade dispute between China and the United States. Pentagon leaders told a congressional committee this month that cyberattacks from China are increasingly sophisticated.", "Hong Kong legislative work suspended amid political crisis,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's legislature suspended meetings Thursday following violent clashes between police and protesters who oppose a bill allowing suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial and that is seen as tightening Beijing's control over the territory.The events in the former British colony mark possibly its biggest political crisis since being handed over to Chinese rule in 1997, and they pose a profound challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping.Nearly two years ago, Xi issued a stern address in the city stating that Beijing would not tolerate Hong Kong becoming a base for what the ruling Communist Party considers a foreign-inspired campaign to undermine its rule over the vast nation of 1.4 billion people.Yet the mostly young throngs of well-organized protesters seemed little deterred by such threats, even as they took pains to remain anonymous by wearing masks, declining to give their full names to journalists and using cash rather than stored value cards to buy subway tickets.The demonstrations follow the 30th anniversary of China's bloody suppression of the student-led pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Hong Kong held one of its biggest rallies in recent years to honor the hundreds or possibly thousands of demonstrators killed in the army assault and to demand a full investigation into the crackdown, in what was seen as a further sign of defiance against Beijing.Xi's administration is also dealing with the trade war with the United States that has thrown its export-driven economic model into question, potentially threatening its relationship with China's urban middle class that has been predicated on accepting strict political controls in exchange for improving standards of living. As one of the world's most important financial centers, Hong Kong also stands to suffer from the continuing impasse, adding to frustrations among young people over stagnating salaries and skyrocketing housing prices.Heavy rain Thursday morning kept fresh street protests from following those Wednesday the shut down government headquarters and the Legislative Council on the day it was to debate the extradition bill. More than 70 people were hurt.Police kept a heavy presence around the government compound on Thursday while protesters sought to maintain pressure by blocking doors on subway trains and driving slowly on main thoroughfares. In their black garb, use of social media and amorphous organization demonstrators appeared reflected the tactics of leftwing activists in Europe and the United States referred to as the \"Black Bloc,\" who have come to prominence at anti-globalization and anti-capitalist protests such as that surrounding the 2017 Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg.Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam declared Wednesday's violence \"rioting,\" that was \"intolerable in any civilized society that respects the rule of law.\" That designation could substantially increase the legal penalties for those arrested for taking part.\"Intense confrontation is surely not the solution to ease disputes and resolve controversies,\" Lam said according to an official news release.Beijing has condemned the protests but so far not indicated whether it was planning harsher measures. In past instances of unrest the authorities have waited months or years before rounding up protest leaders.", "Hong Kong traffic flowing day after political crisis flared,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,13,2019": "HONG KONG--Traffic was restored in the heart of Hong Kong on Thursday following violent clashes the day before between police and protesters who oppose legislation that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.The events in the former British colony mark possibly its biggest political crisis since its handover to Chinese rule in 1997, and pose a profound challenge to Chinese president and head of the ruling Communist Party Xi Jinping.Nearly two years ago, Xi issued a stern address in the city stating that Beijing would not tolerate Hong Kong becoming a base for what the party considers a foreign-inspired campaign to undermine its rule.

The council's official online calendar said no meetings were planned for Thursday.Protesters said they were seeking to block the passage of the legislation they see as part of Beijing's moves to tighten its grip over Hong Kong, which was promised the right to maintain its own political, economic and social institutions for 50 years following the end of British rule.", "\u00e2\u0080\u0098We will use force\u00e2\u0080\u0099: HK police fire tear gas as protesters throw bottles,REUTERS,June,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong police fired tear gas and pepper spray at bottle-throwing demonstrators who charged officers with umbrellas outside the city's legislature, angry at an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial.Tens of thousands of protesters had gathered peacefully in the Chinese-ruled city before tempers flared. Police warned them back, saying: \"We will use force.\"The protesters, most of them young people dressed in black, had erected barricades as they prepared to hunker down for an extended occupation of the area, in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy \"Occupy\" protests that gridlocked the former British colony in 2014.Protesters rallied in and around Lung Wo Road, a main east-west artery near the offices of embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, as hundreds of armed riot police, some with plastic shields, warned them to stop advancing.\"Didn't we say at the end of the Umbrella movement we would be back?\" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said, referring to the name often used for the \"Occupy\" demonstrations, whose trademark was the yellow umbrella.\"Now we are back!\" she said as supporters echoed her words.Others once again called for Lam to step down.Opposition to the bill on Sunday triggered Hong Kong's biggest political demonstration since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"once country, two systems\" deal guaranteeing it special autonomy, including freedom of assembly, free press and independent judiciary.But many accuse China of extensive meddling since, including obstruction of democratic reforms, interference with local elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.Lam has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite deep concerns in the Asian financial hub, including among business leaders, that it could undermine those freedoms and investor confidence and erode the city's competitive advantages.The government said debate on the bill that was due to take place in the city's 70-seat Legislative Council on Wednesday would be delayed until further notice.The legislature is controlled by a pro-Beijing majority.\"We won't leave till they scrap the law,\" said one young man wearing a black mask and gloves.\"Carrie Lam has underestimated us. We won't let her get away with this.\"Beijing again reiterated that the \"one country, two systems\" formula was best for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability.\"The practice of 'one country, two systems' in Hong Kong has achieved remarkable success. This is an undeniable objective fact,\" Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman An Fengshan told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Many of the protesters, who skipped work, school or university to join the rally, defied police calls to retreat and passed around provisions, including medical supplies, goggles, water and food.Some stockpiled bricks broken away from pavements.Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung urged the protesters to stop occupying the road and appealed for calm and restraint. \"We also appeal to the people who are stationed to ... disperse as soon as possible, and not to try to defy/challenge the law,\" he said.The demonstrators rallied just a stone's throw from the heart of the financial center, where glittering skyscrapers house the offices of some of the world's biggest companies, including HSBC.The massive rally was also within sight of the Hong Kong garrison of China's People's Liberation Army, whose presence in the city has been one of the most sensitive elements of the 1997 handover.Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia and HSBC suspended bank operations at some branches in the area.A spokesman for bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said Lam would not attend a cocktail reception on Wednesday as previously planned.The proposed bill has attracted widespread criticism at home and abroad, prompting rare criticism from judges, Hong Kong's business community, some pro-establishment figures and several foreign governments and business chambers.Demonstrators began joining overnight protests earlier on Wednesday as businesses across the city prepared to go on strike.Lam has sought to soothe public concerns and said her administration was creating additional amendments to the bill, including safeguarding human rights.Under the proposed law, Hong Kong residents, as well as foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, would all be at risk if they were wanted on the mainland.Sunday's protest, which organizers said saw more than a million people take to the streets, in addition to a growing backlash against the extradition bill, could raise questions about Lam's ability to govern effectively.The protests have plunged Hong Kong into political crisis, just as the 2014 demonstrations did, heaping pressure on Lam's administration and her official backers in Beijing.The failure of the 2014 protests to wrest concessions on democracy from Beijing, coupled with the prosecutions of at least 100 mostly young protesters, initially discouraged many from returning to the streets. That changed on Sunday.The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong called on the government not to pass the bill \"hurriedly\" and urged Christians to pray for the city. Lam, who warned against \"radical action\" at the protests, is a Catholic.Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, as reasons why the Hong Kong bill should not proceed.China denies accusations that it tramples on human rights and official media said this week \"foreign forces\" were trying to damage China by creating chaos over the extradition bill.", "New Zealand court stops man from being extradited to China,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,12,2019": "WELLINGTON--A New Zealand court on Tuesday stopped a man accused of killing a woman in Shanghai a decade ago from being extradited to China, at least for now, due to concerns he could be tortured.The long-running case represents the first time China has attempted to extradite a suspect from New Zealand, and the Court of Appeal said the issues in the case were difficult. It concluded torture is illegal in China but remains widespread in its criminal justice system.The court ruled New Zealand Justice Minister Andrew Little must reconsider whether Kyung Yup Kim should be extradited to China, where he faces one count of intentional homicide.The ruling comes at a time that Hong Kong is considering a bill that would allow suspects in the semi-autonomous territory to be extradited to mainland China. The proposal has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets in the largest protests there in at least a decade.Critics believe the legislation would risk Hong Kong residents, who were promised they could maintain greater freedoms after the former British colony's handover to China in 1997, being entrapped in China's opaque judicial system.New Zealand doesn't have a formal extradition agreement with China and the case is considered an important precedent.According to court documents, Kim is a Korean citizen who moved to New Zealand 30 years ago with his family when he was aged 14. He is accused of killing a 20-year-old woman, Pei Yun Chen, in Shanghai in 2009. Chinese police say they have forensic and circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.Kim claims he has a defense to the charge but won't get a fair trial in China.Kim was arrested in 2011 and spent five years in New Zealand jails as his extradition case proceeded before he was released on bail.In its judgment, the court found that China conceals torture so it's hard to monitor and that there are substantial disincentives for anybody who is detained there to report torture. It said that there is a cultural shift away from torture in China.\"Nevertheless, torture remains widespread and confessions obtained through torture are regularly admitted in evidence,\" the court found in its 99-page judgment.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday that Beijing attaches \"great importance to the protection and promotion of human rights.\"\"The Chinese judicial system effectively guarantees various legal rights of the criminal suspects, and the achievements we have made in terms of human rights protection in the judicial field are there for all to see,\" he said at a regular news briefing.He said it was important to \"uphold justice for the victims.\"\"We hope that New Zealand can handle it in a fair manner and extradite Kim back to China as soon as possible,\" Geng said.", "Hong Kong delays bill debate as protest crowds block entry,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong delayed a legislative session on a contentious extradition bill as thousands of protesters amassed to block entry to the building Wednesday out of concern the measure signaled greater Chinese control and further erosion of civil liberties in the semiautonomous territory.The overwhelmingly young crowd of demonstrators filled nearby streets, overturned barriers and tussled with police outside the government headquarters and offices of the Legislative Council.A statement from the government's press service said the session of the Hong Kong's Legislative Council that was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. would be \"changed to a later time to be determined\" by the council secretariat. Council members would be notified of the time of the meeting later, the statement said.A protester who gave only his first name, Marco, said he hoped the action would persuade Chief Executive Carrie Lam's administration to shelve the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.\"We want the government to just set the legislation aside and not bring it back,\" he said.A fellow protester who gave her name as King said the protest was a watershed moment for Hong Kong's young generation, who face difficult job prospects and skyrocketing housing prices.\"We have to stand up for our rights or they will be taken away,\" she said.The reluctance of protesters to be identified by their full names and professions--many wore surgical masks to obscure their facial features--reflected an increasingly hard-line approach to civil unrest by the authorities. Such actions are never tolerated in mainland China, and Hong Kong residents can face travel bans and other repercussions if they cross the border.Another statement from the government's information office said access roads leading to the Central Government Offices were blocked and police has implemented traffic arrangements.Staff members were advised not to go to into work and those already on the premises were told to \"stay at their working place until further notice.\"Under its \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong was supposed to be guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British rule in 1997. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.The government pushed ahead with plans to present the amendments to the legislature on Wednesday despite a weekend protest by hundreds of thousands of people that was the territory's largest political demonstration in more than a decade. A crowd began gathering outside the Legislative Council on Tuesday night, and U.S. Consulate is warning people to avoid the area, exercise caution and keep a low profile. Some businesses closed for the day, and labor strikes and class boycotts were also called.The legislation has become a lightning rod for concerns about Beijing's increasing control over the semiautonomous territory.Lam has consistently defended the legislation as necessary to close legal loopholes with other countries and territories. A vote was scheduled on June 20.Sunday's protest was widely seen as reflecting growing apprehension about relations with the Communist Party-ruled mainland, whose leader, Xi Jinping, has said he has zero tolerance for those demanding greater self-rule for Hong Kong.Critics believe the extradition legislation would put Hong Kong residents at risk of being entrapped in China's judicial system, in which opponents of Communist Party rule have been charged with economic crimes or ill-defined national security offenses, and would not be guaranteed free trials.Lam, who canceled her regular question and answer session on Wednesday, said the government has considered concerns from the private sector and altered the bill to improve human rights safeguards. She said without the changes, Hong Kong would risk becoming a haven for fugitives.She emphasized that extradition cases would be decided by Hong Kong courts.Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a lawyer and member of Lam's administration advisory committee, said Sunday's protest showed a lack of trust in Hong Kong's administration, partly because Lam was selected by a small number of electors rather than by popular vote. However, China's patience with Hong Kong's demands has its limits, Tong said.\"We need to gain the trust and confidence of Beijing so they can allow us the freedom of political reform,\" Tong said. \"They don't want to see Hong Kong as a base of subversion. And I'm sorry, we're doing exactly that.\"Opponents of the proposed extradition amendments say the changes would significantly compromise Hong Kong's legal independence, long viewed as one of the crucial differences between the territory and mainland China.Hong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing agreements and to others on an individual basis. China has been excluded from those agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record.The mainland's ruling Communist Party exerts influence on the Hong Kong government. Lam was elected in 2017 by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites and was widely seen as the Communist Party's favored candidate.The Legislative Council includes a sizable camp of pro-Beijing lawmakers.Those in Hong Kong who anger China's central government have come under greater pressure since Xi came to power in 2012.The detention of several Hong Kong booksellers in late 2015 intensified worries about the erosion of Hong Kong's rule of law. The booksellers vanished before resurfacing in police custody in mainland China. Among them, Swedish citizen Gui Minhai is currently being investigated on charges of leaking state secrets after he sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders.In April, nine leaders of a 2014 pro-democracy protest movement known as the \"Umbrella Revolution\" were convicted on public nuisance and other charges.In May, Germany confirmed it had granted asylum to two people from Hong Kong who, according to media reports, were activists fleeing tightening restrictions at home. It was the first known case in recent years of a Western government accepting political refugees from Hong Kong.", "Hong Kong pushes bill allowing extraditions to China despite biggest protest since handover,REUTERS,June,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vowed on Monday to push ahead with amendments to laws allowing suspects to be extradited to mainland China, a day after the city's biggest protest since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Riot police ringed Hong Kong's legislature and fought back a group of several hundred protesters who stayed behind early on Monday after Sunday's peaceful march that organizers said drew more than a million people, or one in seven of the city's people.\"I don't think it is (an) appropriate decision for us now to pull out of this bill because of the very important objectives that this bill is intended to achieve,\" a somber Lam told reporters while flanked by security and justice chiefs.\"While we will continue to do the communication and explanation, there is very little merit to be gained to delay the bill. It will just cause more anxiety and divisiveness in society.\"The protests plunged Hong Kong into political crisis, just as months of pro-democracy \"Occupy\" demonstrations did in 2014, heaping pressure on Lam's administration and her official backers in Beijing. Chants echoed through city streets on Sunday calling on her to quit. \"Extradite yourself, Carrie!\" one placard read.The rendition bill has generated unusually broad opposition, from normally pro-establishment business people and lawyers to students, pro-democracy figures and religious groups fearing the further erosion of Hong Kong's legal autonomy and the difficulty of ensuring even basic judicial protections in mainland China.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Monday that Washington was gravely concerned about the proposed amendments and warned that \"continued erosion of the 'one country, two systems' framework puts at risk Hong Kong's long-established special status in international affairs.\"She said the United States was concerned the amendments could damage Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business environment \"and subject our citizens residing in or visiting Hong Kong to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capricious judicial system.\"Any amendments \"should be pursued with great care and in full consultation with a broad range of local and international stakeholders who may be affected,\" she said.A 1992 U.S. law recognizes Hong Kong's special status and allows the United States to engage with it as a non-sovereign entity distinct from China in matters of trade and economics. Areas of special treatment include visas, law enforcement, including extraditions, and investment.A U.S. congressional commission said in a report last month that amending the extradition laws could provide grounds for Washington to re-examine elements of its relationship with Hong Kong outlined in the 1992 law.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China under a \"one-country, two-systems\" formula, with guarantees that its autonomy and freedoms, including an independent justice system, would be protected.But many accuse China of extensive meddling in many sectors, denying democratic reforms and squeezing freedoms, interfering with local elections and the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.

This bill is not initiated by the central people's government.

But Taiwanese officials say they will not agree to any transfer if the bill goes ahead, citing rights concerns.In Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, President Tsai Ing-wen said on her Facebook page: \"We support the people of Hong Kong's search for freedom, democracy and human rights.\"Beijing officials have increasingly defended Lam's plan, couching it as a sovereignty issue.

Veteran lawmakers have called on her to resign.The rendition bill has generated unusually broad opposition, from normally pro-establishment business people and lawyers to students, pro-democracy figures and religious groups.Sunday's demonstration capped weeks of growing outrage in the business, diplomatic and legal communities, which fear corrosion of Hong Kong's legal autonomy and the difficulty of ensuring basic judicial protections in mainland China.Lam sought to soothe public concerns and said her administration was creating additional amendments to the bill, including safeguarding human rights.\"This bill is not about the mainland alone.

It appeared to be even bigger than a massive pro-democracy demonstration in 2003 against a proposed national security law, according to Associated Press journalists who covered both events.Late Sunday night, a group of demonstrators broke through barriers at government headquarters, where the march had ended. The crowd briefly pushed its way into the lobby, but police in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to push the protesters outside. Most had dispersed by 1 a.m., but police continued pushing protesters away for kilometers over a period of two to three hours.There was still a strong police presence on streets throughout downtown Hong Kong as of 3 a.m. Monday.A small group of protesters sat with hands tied on the side of Gloucester Road, surrounded by police.People of all ages took part in the march, some pushing strollers and others carrying canes, chanting slogans in the native Cantonese dialect in favor of greater transparency in government.Kiwi Wong, 27, was among the throng, a member of the younger generation who've grown up enjoying relative prosperity but also growing insecurity about what many see as an erosion of the rights Hong Kong residents have enjoyed.\"If I didn't come out now, I don't know when I would have the chance to express my opinion again,\" Wong said. \"Because now we've got to this stage, if you don't come out to try to do what you can, then it will end up too late, you won't be able to say or do anything about it.\"Alex Ng, a 67-year-old retiree, said he joined the protest because \"I think that there was never any public consultation about this law, and there are a lot of uncertainties.\"Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has pushed forward with the legislation despite widespread criticism from human rights and business groups. The amendments have been criticized as eroding Hong Kong's judicial independence by making it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.\"What can we do to get Carrie Lam to listen to us, how many people have to come out to make her reconsider listening to the public?\" said Miu Wong, a 24-year-old office worker who was among the protesters.Tommy Lam, a 29-year-old who is working on his master's degree, said: \"All these people coming out and marching sends a definite message. If the government doesn't listen, there will be tension.\"The Hong Kong government said in a statement late Sunday that it respected the right of its opponents to protest.\"We acknowledge and respect that people have different views on a wide range of issues,\" the statement said. \"The procession today is an example of Hong Kong people exercising their freedom of expression within their rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.\"Hong Kong was guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the so-called \"one country, two systems\" framework. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.Hong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing extradition agreements or to others on an individual basis under a law passed before 1997.China was excluded because of concerns over its poor record on legal independence and human rights. In recent years, mainland authorities have gone after opponents by accusing them of dubious crimes such as tax evasion, crystalizing worries among critics and others.Lam's government argued that the revisions were needed to close legal loopholes, while opponents say that is merely an excuse to pursue China's agenda of reducing Hong Kong's legal independence.Hong Kong's Legislative Council will table the amendments on the bill on Wednesday.\"The people of Hong Kong want to protect our freedom, our freedom of speech, our rule of law, our judicial system, and also our economic foundation, which is welcome to international investors,\" activist Lee Cheuk-yan, a former Hong Kong legislator, said Sunday. \"If international investors lose confidence in Hong Kong because of this evil bill, then Hong Kong, economically, would also be destroyed.\"", "Huge Hong Kong protest expected in last push to scrap extradition bill,REUTERS,June,8,2019": "HONG KONG--At least half a million people in Hong Kong are expected to brave sweltering heat on Sunday to press the government to scrap a proposed extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent to China to face trial, organizers of the march said.A committee of pro-democratic groups has raised turnout estimates and are now eyeing the biggest single-day rally since 2003, when a similar number of protesters forced the government to shelve tighter national security laws.The march will end at the city's Legislative Council, where debates start on Wednesday into sweeping amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance. The extradition bill is due to be passed by the end of the month.After weeks of growing local and international pressure, the protest is expected to reflect the broad range of opposition to the bill, with many saying they simply cannot trust China's court system or its security apparatus.The city's independent legal system was guaranteed under laws governing Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago, and is seen by the financial hub's business and diplomatic communities as its strong remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing.Concerns have spread from the city's democratic and human rights groups to secondary school students, church groups and media lobbies as well as corporate lawyers and pro-establishment business figures, some usually loathe to contradict the government.For the most recent stories on the extradition debate, click on.

By instituting populist policies, he won the allegiance of many of the country's rural majority and urban poor.His political popularity, however, threatened the influence of the country's traditional ruling circle, including royalists, industrialists and the military, and after protests accusing him of abuse of power, the army ousted him in a 2006 coup.The coup set off a long and sometimes violent struggle for power between Thaksin's supporters and opponents. The courts, one of Thailand's most royalist and conservative institutions, played a major role in fighting comebacks by his political machine with controversial rulings that consistently whittled away at his allies, ultimately forcing three other prime ministers loyal to him to step down.Critics of the courts suggested Thailand came under the sway of a system known as juristocracy or judiocracy, in which the judiciary exercises political power overriding other branches of government, including elected officials.Thailand's decades-old official lottery has been dogged time and again by rigging and corruption scandals.The court's ruling Thursday appeared to claim that the lottery scheme initiated under Thaksin involved unacceptable financial risk to the government.Thai news reports said dozens of other officials were previously tried and convicted for involvement, with some senior figures given suspended prison terms.", "Asian stocks trail U.S. rise on Mexico trade deal optimism,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,7,2019": "Asian shares were mostly higher Friday on investor optimism about a possible trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico before tariffs take effect.Japan's Nikkei 225 gained nearly 0.4 percent to 20,850.24 in morning trading, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 6,416.50.

Hong Kong will be just another city in China.\"Calls to the Chinese embassy and Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office in Berlin seeking comment went unanswered.The legal amendments being pushed by the special administrative region's government mark one of the starkest challenges to Hong Kong's legal system and are increasingly troubling its business, political and diplomatic communities.The city's independent legal system was guaranteed under the laws governing Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago and is seen by the financial hub's business and diplomatic communities as its strongest remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing. Hong Kong's extensive autonomy is guaranteed until 2047.Wong spoke to Reuters before a seminar on human rights in China in the Bundestag Lower House on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, which was marked with a somber candlelight vigil in Hong Kong attended by tens of thousands.The proposed changes provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.The amendments allow for the chief executive to both seek the arrest of a fugitive and sign off on their extradition once approved by the courts, including any appeals and judicial reviews.But they also eliminate the oversight roles of the chief executive's Cabinet and the city's legislative body, which can currently step in to evaluate extradition arrangements.Wong is one of two Hong Kong activists facing rioting charges in Hong Kong who have been granted refugee status by Germany. China's Xinhua state news agency on May 25 said Beijing had made \"solemn representations\" to Germany over its decision, demanding Berlin correct its \"mistakes.\"Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has also expressed \"deep regrets and strong objections\" to Germany about the case.

When required to appear in public in the past, he sometimes wore a balaclava.Despite his precautions, he said Chinese authorities somehow discovered his identity last year, possibly through digital surveillance while he was planning the Hong Kong show, which would have been his first international exhibition.His works include neon sculptures of deceased Chinese dissident and Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo and a cartoon of Chinese President Xi Jinping holding a rifle next to a dead Winnie the Pooh.Chinese Internet users have in the past likened Pooh's portly appearance to Xi. A small number of people have even used Pooh as a symbol of resistance.Badiucao said he was told by a source that two \"policemen\" from China would show up for the Hong Kong event--stoking fears he might be abducted to mainland China, which took back control of the former British colony in 1997.A Hong Kong-based publisher of books critical of China's leaders was abducted in Thailand in 2015, one of five people in the Hong Kong book trade who went missing that year and later appeared in custody in mainland China.\"Hong Kong is like an egg falling to the ground,\" Badiucao said. \"It might not have impacted the ground but it's already on the way.\"China's main representative \"Liaison Office\" in the city gave no response to a Reuters request for comment.Badiucao took part in Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protests that blocked roads for months in a direct challenge to Beijing, but he says he won't return. He criticized a proposed extradition law that would allow suspects in Hong Kong to be sent back to mainland China for the first time.\"The extradition law is definitely a new trap, allowing mainland China much more power to use its controlling with violence directly in Hong Kong,\" he said. \"It also generates huge fear.\"Last year, he launched a public art project on China's \"Tank Man,\" the nameless individual who stood in front of a row of tanks a day after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in an act of defiance. The man's identity and fate remain unknown.The artist urged people around the world to pose in public as Tank Man, in white shirt, black pants, and holding two bags.\"In order to pass down memory, it's always about the next generation, how to engage them, how to awaken them from this kind of political indifference,\" he said.China's Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a request for comment on the fate of Tank Man. When asked about Tank Man by Reuters at a Foreign Ministry media briefing, spokesman Geng Shuang said: \"I have no understanding of these situations you mention.\"Despite blanket Chinese censorship of June 4, the artist said he would reveal the truth through art.\"The physical body can be crushed or damaged, but the spirit lives for much longer,\" he said. \"I hope within my art and within my action ... will be a way to pass on the spirit of '89.\"", "China handles Tiananmen anniversary with usual silence,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,5,2019": "BEIJING--Dissidents silenced. Security tightened. References scrubbed from the Internet.China imposed an information lockdown Tuesday on the 30th anniversary of its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, a stark reminder that three decades later, the possibility of democratic change has all but evaporated.Extra checkpoints and street closures greeted tourists who showed up before 5 a.m. to watch the daily flag-raising ceremony at the square in the center of Beijing. People overseas found themselves blocked from posting anything to a popular Chinese social media site.China has largely succeeded in wiping the events of June 3-4, 1989, from the public consciousness at home, where the anniversary of the crackdown passed like any other weekday. To Western critics, who this year included U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, China has a simple answer: Our model works.\"The Chinese government has long had a clear conclusion about the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in response to Pompeo. China's economic success \"fully proves that the development path we chose is completely correct and has been firmly supported by the people.\"The seven-week-long Tiananmen Square protests and their bloody end, in which hundreds if not thousands of people are believed to have died, snuffed out a tentative shift in China toward political liberalization.The mantra of the ruling Communist Party has become stability over all else, and the party says the stability it has delivered has been a necessary underpinning to the country's economic growth.For many Chinese, life is better. Incomes have risen, and social restrictions such as family size and where people can live have been loosened. It's political freedom that remains strictly controlled.Half a dozen activists could not be reached Tuesday by phone or text. One who could, Beijing-based Hu Jia, said he had been taken last week by security agents to the northeastern coastal city of Qinghuangdao.Chinese authorities routinely take dissidents away on what are euphemistically called \"vacations\" or otherwise silence them during sensitive political times.\"This is a reflection of their fears, their terror, not ours,\" Hu said.Under current President Xi Jinping, the government has tightened control over everything from religion to the Internet in an apparent bid to make the Communist Party central to the future of China.\"I don't think that in the foreseeable future there is the possibility for another mass movement against the regime, because the system of control is so complete,\" said Andrew Nathan, a professor of Chinese politics at Columbia University.Chinese overseas reported on Twitter that they were blocked from posting on Weibo, a popular social networking site. Weibo did not respond to phone and email requests for comment.Even those who know what happened 30 years ago are reluctant to talk about it in public. A 24-year-old designer said last week in Beijing that he thought it was quite a pity when he learned that many had died.\"But it's really not convenient to talk about it,\" he said, giving only the name he goes by in English, Tony.Any commemoration of the event is not allowed in mainland China, though tens of thousands turned out for an annual candlelight vigil in Hong Kong. The Chinese territory has relatively greater freedoms than the mainland, though even there, activists are concerned about the erosion of those liberties in recent years.Pompeo issued a statement Monday saluting what he called the \"heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up thirty years ago ... to demand their rights.\" He said that U.S. hopes that China would become a more open and tolerant society have been dashed.He and his European Union counterpart Federica Mogherini urged China to come clean on what happened and how many died.\"Acknowledgement of these events, and of those killed, detained or missing in connection with the Tiananmen Square protests, is important for future generations and for the collective memory,\" Mogherini said in a statement.Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, said that \"some people in the U.S. always regard themselves as others' teachers and interfere in other countries' internal affairs under the guise of so-called democracy and human rights, while turning a blind eye to problems at home. The Chinese people have seen through their hypocrisy and sinister intentions.\"The crackdown set the Communist Party on a path of repression, Nathan said, adding that China would likely be a very different place if the nation's rulers had ended the protests peacefully through dialogue instead of by force.\"They embarked on a strategy of not dialoguing with the people,\" he said. \"The party knows best, the party decides, and the people have no voice. So that requires more and more intense repression of all of the forces in society that want to be heard.\"", "Hong Kong activists hold Tiananmen candlelight vigil,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,5,2019": "HONG KONG--Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong gathered Tuesday night to mark 30 years since China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, underscoring continuing concern for Chinese human rights in the semiautonomous territory, even as its own civil liberties are under threat.Hong Kong is the only region under Beijing's jurisdiction that holds significant public commemorations of the 1989 crackdown and memorials for its victims. Hong Kong has a degree of freedom not seen on the mainland as a legacy of British rule that ended in 1997.The annual vigil at Hong Kong's Victoria Park near the bustling Causeway Bay shopping district appeared to draw tens of thousands of participants who filled several football fields and held candles in the sultry night air. Following an introduction of songs in the city's Cantonese dialect and traditional string music, a minute of silence was held for the Tiananmen crackdown victims.\"By being here, I'm standing for truth and justice, even though I've no hope the Chinese central government will ever do justice to the protesters,\" said participant Stanley Lui, 42.Beijing transplant Jay Jiang, 16, said unlike many on the mainland, she knew about the crackdown even as a young child. The 10th grader was taking part in the Hong Kong vigil for the first time.\"The bottom line is the government should not deceive the people about what happened,\" said Jiang, beads of sweat dotting her cheeks.Estimates of the number of vigil participants varied widely, with police putting the figure at 37,000 and organizers at 180,000.This year's vigil featured a replica of the \"Goddess of Democracy,\" a plaster sculpture of a female figure holding a torch that was displayed in Tiananmen Square in the days leading up to the crackdown, which took place on the night of June 3-4, 1989, and is believed to have killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people.\"That statue was crushed by tanks at the June 4 crackdown, the June 4 massacre. So we are rebuilding this here ... to symbolize that we are still continuing to fight for democracy, and continue on the spirit of the '89 democratic protests,\" said Chow Hang Tung, vice chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which organizes the annual event.Alliance chairman Albert Ho said many participants were seeking to \"demonstrate their commitment to the cause of democracy\" on the 30th anniversary and \"speaking truth to power, especially for those who are silent in the mainland.\"Visitor Winnie Ma, a 55-year-old church worker, said she brought her 80-year-old mother to the park especially to view the statue on the 30th anniversary.\"I don't know if she will see it vindicated, but I hope that I will be able to,\" Ma said.Meanwhile, at the University of Hong Kong, a dozen students laid flower bouquets at the \"Pillar of Shame,\" a sculpture by Danish artist Jens Galschiot commemorating the crackdown's victims.\"Just because I wasn't born then and never experienced the event, there's no stopping me from reminding others like me of this and carrying on the collective memory,\" said 18-year-old student Donald Chung.Students later observed a minute of silence in remembrance of the crackdown's victims before scrubbing the pillar clean in an annual ritual.Recent years have witnessed a generational divide about how best to memorialize the crackdown, and since 2015, Hong Kong university students have arranged their own commemorations separate from the main candlelight vigil.\"People who attend the vigil consider themselves Chinese. We disagree with this identity,\" said Jordan Pang, acting chair of the Hong Kong University Students' Union's current affairs committee.\"I think the young generation and most students consider themselves Hong Kongers. If we need to commemorate, we do not want to use (the vigil) to commemorate,\" Pang said.Despite its pro-democracy theme, young Hong Kongers see the vigil as promoting Chinese nationalism, said Samson Yuen, a professor of political science at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.\"They argue that Hong Kong needs to determine its own future. Hong Kong may need to seek independence from China and they believe that June 4 is a battleground,\" Yuen said.Thirty years ago, the Tiananmen protesters gained widespread support and sympathy from residents of Hong Kong, whose return to Chinese rule had been agreed upon just years earlier. Hong Kong supporters helped sustain the protests with donated funds and equipment and, following the crackdown, mobilized to smuggle wanted student leaders out of the country, sometimes with the assistance of organized crime groups known as triads.The spirit of political activism has now passed to a younger generation, crystalizing in the 2014 Occupy protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, which laid siege to Hong Kong government headquarters and paralyzed the city's financial district for 79 days.The movement fizzled with no concessions from the Hong Kong government for free elections, and the authorities have since cracked down hard on its leaders, sentencing nine in April on public nuisance and other charges.More recently, activists, as well as business and legal associations, have protested amendments making it easier to send criminal suspects in Hong Kong to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.Chinese President Xi Jinping has been seen as extending his crackdown on civil liberties to Hong Kong, threatening the territory's promised semiautonomy.A march against the amendments is scheduled for Sunday ahead of the government's expected push for passage on June 12.The extradition law amendments have put China's chosen Hong Kong leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on the defensive. On Monday, she announced further changes aimed at placating critics.Asked Tuesday whether she agreed with China's justifications for the army crackdown in 1989, Lam did not answer directly, but said Hong Kong was a \"very free society\" that upholds the rights and freedoms of individuals.\"So today, if there are public gatherings to express their views and feelings on a particular historic incident, we fully respect those views,\" Lam said.Along with concerns over the amended extradition law, Lam's administration has faced accusations that it was abusing public order statutes to intimidate potential protesters. That prompted Germany last year to grant political asylum to two Hong Kong dissidents, Ray Wong Toi Yeung and fellow pro-democracy protester Alan Li Tung Sing.In an opinion essay in Tuesday's New York Times, Wong said that \"the situation is dire\" in Hong Kong. \"The Chinese government keeps repressing, but people keep resisting,\" he wrote.Wong was to speak at a seminar marking the Tiananmen crackdown hosted by the Germany's opposition Greens party.Meanwhile in Taiwan, hundreds of people gathered in the self-governing island's capital, Taipei, on Tuesday to mark the Tiananmen anniversary. The crowd was addressed by activists and Taiwan's vice president.Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, took to Facebook to highlight the contrast between her democratically elected government and China's authoritarian communist system.Tsai said China had shown that it not only had no intention of reflecting on \"that year's mistake\" but also planned to continue covering up the truth about the 1989 crackdown.She cited comments Sunday by China's defense minister at a forum in Singapore defending the army's bloody assault on protesters and Beijing citizens, as well as Hong Kong's refusal to allow entry to former student leader Feng Congde.\"Please rest easy, Taiwan will absolutely adhere to democracy, adhere to freedom, regardless of threats or infiltration. As long as I am president for just one day, there is no way Taiwan will yield to pressure,\" Tsai wrote.China considers Taiwan its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary. Beijing has proposed ruling Taiwan under the same \"one country, two systems\" formula applied to Hong Kong, something the islands voters have overwhelmingly rejected.", "30 years after Tiananmen, China continues coverup, says Taiwan,REUTERS,June,4,2019": "TAIPEI--China continues to cover up the truth about the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, Taiwan's president said on Tuesday, ahead of vigils in the region to commemorate the event.Tuesday marks 30 years since Chinese troops opened fire to end the student-led unrest in Beijing.Chinese authorities ban any public commemoration and have never released a full death toll. Estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand.\"The Chinese government not only did not plan to repent for the past mistake, but it also continued to cover up the truth,\" Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in a Facebook post.\"Please be reassured--Taiwan will definitely defend democracy and freedom. Regardless of threats and infiltration, as long as I'm the president, Taiwan would not bow to pressure,\" she said.The post, which was accompanied by a cartoon of Tsai holding a candle, also expressed concern for China's \"erosion of freedom\" in Hong Kong, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula.Democratic Taiwan tends to use the Tiananmen Square anniversary to criticize China and call for it to face up to its actions. China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be taken back by force if necessary.Tsai's comments came ahead of large candlelight vigils in the region, including in Taipei and Hong Kong, to commemorate the events of 1989 that remain a taboo subject in China.Beijing has increased government suppression of rights activism, pushing the demonstrators' original goals further away than ever.Financial information provider Refinitiv, under pressure from China's government, has removed from its Eikon terminal Reuters news stories related to the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown.Tsai's government urged Beijing on Monday to \"sincerely repent\" for the Tiananmen crackdown, while a Chinese newspaper said nobody in China was interested in dragging up the past.China suspects Tsai and her ruling party of pushing formal independence for Taiwan, a red line for China.", "Taiwan lashes back at Chinese defense minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threats,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,June,3,2019": "TAIPEI--Taiwan lashed out at the Chinese defense minister's renewed threat to use force to assert China's claim to the island, accusing Beijing of creating unease in the region and seeking to \"expand its hegemony.\"A statement from the Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council targeted comments Defense Minister Wei Fenghe made in Singapore on Sunday in which he said China would \"resolutely take action\" to defend its claim to Taiwan and the South China Sea.The council asserted later Sunday that Taiwan has never been a part of the People's Republic of China and would never accept Beijing's threats. It accused China of \"challenging international norms and order\" and said Beijing's claim to seek peaceful development had been recognized internationally as \"a lie of the ages.\"\"We need to remind the public that the Chinese Communist Party is practicing anti-democracy, anti-peace between the two sides of the strait and further resorting to war. This is the main cause of the tension in the Taiwan Strait and the region, and it is the source of danger and provocation against peace and stability,\" the statement said.It said Taiwan, which is heavily dependent on U.S. arms for its defense, would continue to strengthen its armed forces, \"defend its national sovereignty and democratic system,\" and uphold the right of the island's 23 million people to \"freely choose their own future.\"The sides split amid civil war in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek moved his Nationalist government to Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover of the mainland. Taiwan had been a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945.China considers annexation of Taiwan to be an inevitability, and in his speech, Wei said Beijing was prepared to fight any opponent to make that happen.\"China must be and will be reunified. We find no excuse not to do so. If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs, at all costs, for national unity,\" Wei said.China has boosted such muscle flexing since the 2016 election of independence-leaning Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who has infuriated Beijing by refusing to endorse its contention that Taiwan is a part of China. Surveys show solid majorities of Taiwanese favor maintaining the current state of de-facto independence and reject China's call for unification with Beijing under the \"one country, two systems\" framework now applied to Hong Kong.China has also upped diplomatic pressure by poaching several of the island's dwindling number of allies and barring Taiwan's representatives from international gatherings, no matter how non-political in nature. It has also discouraged Chinese tourists from visiting the island and sought to win over Taiwanese investors by offering them many of the same terms and conditions offered to native Chinese.", "Huawei to sell undersea cable business, buyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filing shows,REUTERS,June,3,2019": "HONG KONG--Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., plans to sell its undersea telecom cable business, showed a buyer's filing on Monday, in its first major asset sale since the United States ratcheted up accusations of the Chinese firm being a vehicle for espionage.Hengtong Optic-Electric Co., Ltd., an optical telecommunication network products company based in Jiangsu province, said in the filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it signed a letter of intent with Huawei Technologies subsidiary Huawei Tech Investment Co., Ltd., on May 31 to buy its 51 percent stake in Huawei Marine Systems Co., Ltd., via cash and share issuance.The filing did not disclose a price.Huawei Technologies declined to provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. The potential sale comes as Huawei's main business of making and selling telecom network equipment and smartphones is under intense global scrutiny as the United States works to persuade allies that Huawei's products pose a security risk.Huawei has said it would not cooperate with any Chinese state request to access its systems for intelligence purposes. Even so, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a trade ban last month that threatens to significantly disrupt its supply chain.In March, The Wall Street Journal cited U.S. security officials as saying the suspected security risk extended to undersea cables built by Huawei Marine.Undersea cables are the backbone of global internet traffic. Huawei has been gaining share in the market dominated by U.S. firm SubCom, Japan's NEC Corp. and Europe's Alcatel-Lucent, since Huawei Marine was established in 2008 as a joint venture with Britain's Global Marine.Huawei Marine has participated in 90 projects worldwide and built 50,361 kilometers of cables, its website showed, including a 6,000 km cable connecting Africa and South America for the first time completed in September last year.It booked 2018 net profit of 115 million yuan ($16.66 million or 1.8 billion yen) on revenue of 394 million yuan, according to Huawei Technologies' annual report.The annual report also showed Huawei Technologies gained majority voting rights on Huawei Marine's board in August 2018, with Global Marine retaining a 49 percent non-controlling interest.Global Marine did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Monday, and calls to its Asia-Pacific office in Singapore were not answered.According to exchange filings, Hengtong Optic-Electric's largest shareholder is privately owned Hengtong Group with a 15.66 percent stake. Hengtong Group's founder and owner Cui Genliang is the second-largest shareholder with 14.95 percent.Hengtong Group on its website said it is China's biggest solutions provider in fiber-optic networks and smart electricity grids, with over 70 subsidiaries at home and abroad, including Indonesia-listed cable maker PT Voksel Electric Tbk.Hengtong Optic-Electric booked 2018 net profit of 2.5 billion yuan on revenue of 33.9 billion yuan, according to its annual report. It has delivered over 10,000 km of undersea cables, including for projects in Papua New Guinea, Chile, Bolivia and Mexico, the annual report showed.Trading of Hengtong Optic-Electric shares was suspended on Monday pending deal discussions.", "Global recession fears grow as manufacturing shrinks in Asia,REUTERS,June,3,2019": "HONG KONG--Factory activity contracted in most Asian countries last month as an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing raised fears of a global economic downturn and heaped pressure on policymakers in the region and beyond to roll out more stimulus.Such growth indicators are likely to deteriorate further in coming months as higher trade tariffs take their toll on global commerce and further dent business and consumer sentiment leading to job losses and delays in investment decisions.Some economists predict a world recession and a renewed race to the bottom on interest rates if trade tensions fail to ease at a Group of 20 summit in Osaka at the end of June, when presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could meet.In China, Asia's economic heartbeat, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed modest expansion at 50.2, offering investors some near-term relief after an official gauge on Friday showed contraction.The outlook, however, remained grim as output growth slipped, factory prices stalled and businesses were the least optimistic on production since the survey series began in April 2012.PMIs were below the 50-point mark separating contraction from expansion in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan, came below expectations in Vietnam and improved slightly in the Philippines.\"The additional shock from the escalated trade tensions is not going to be good for global trade and if demand in the U.S., China and Europe continues to soften, which is very likely, it will bode ill for Asia as a whole,\" said Aidan Yao, senior emerging markets economist at AXA Investment Managers.\"In terms of the monetary policy response, almost everywhere the race is going to be to the downside.\"Central banks in Australia and India are expected to cut rates this week, with others around the world seen following suit in coming weeks and months. HSBC economist Jingyang Chen said the PMI figures could mean \"Beijing will double down on easing for the private corporate sector.\"Euro zone activity is expected to shrink as well, while U.S. manufacturing is expected to grow steadily, although economists expect the global malaise to eventually feed back into the U.S. economy. Fed funds rate futures are now almost fully pricing in a rate cut by September, with about 50 percent chance of a move by July 30-31.J.P. Morgan expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates twice this year, a major change from its previous forecast that rates will stay on hold until the end of 2020.In India, where growth depends largely on domestic demand, the manufacturing sector expanded at its quickest pace in three months, with sentiment boosted by a dramatic election win by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.. But further economic reforms will be crucial, as highlighted by Friday's data showing the economy growing at its slowest pace in more than four years in January-March.The expansion in Philippines reflects strong domestic demand and less reliance on trade, while for Vietnam it is a reflection of a diversion of business and trade flows due to the tariffs.A Societe Generale analysis shows that in industries affected by the implemented tariffs--such as capital goods and some electronics--Germany, Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan have each won more U.S. business.Vietnam has been the biggest beneficiary in industries where tariffs are a threat, such as smartphones, and is also seeing investment from companies moving production out of China.\"Southeast Asian countries, especially Vietnam and Thailand, are often cited as the top choices, and indeed they look ready,\" Societe Generale analysts said in a Friday note.Ominously, South Korean exports--seen as a bellwether of world growth--fell 9.4 percent in May, worse than a median forecast for a 5.6 percent decline, data released on Saturday showed.The trade conflict between China and the United States suddenly escalated last month when Trump raised tariffs on hundreds of billions of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent and threatened levies on all Chinese goods.If that were to happen, and China were to retaliate, \"we could end up in a (global) recession in three quarters,\" says Chetan Ahya, global head of economics at Morgan Stanley.Washington's new tariff threats against Mexico last week also contributed to global recession fears, with stock markets tumbling around the world. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.121 percent, a nadir last seen in September 2017.Over the weekend tensions flared again between China and the United States over trade, technology and security.China's Defense Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea, while acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Washington would no longer \"tiptoe\" around Chinese behavior in Asia.On Friday, China also threatened to unveil an unprecedented hit-list of \"unreliable\" foreign firms, groups and individuals that harm the interests of Chinese companies. That came after Washington last month put Huawei on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Chinese telecoms equipment giant.\"We take this seriously. It means that the trade war has not only become a technology war but also a broad-based business war. There will be more retaliation actions from China, especially for the technology sector,\" Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING, said, adding that the tensions over Taiwan were a background worry rather than a pressing concern.", "Vietnam culls 2 million pigs, urges nation to fight swine fever,REUTERS,May,31,2019": "HANOI--Vietnam said on Friday it has culled 2 million pigs in a bid to curb an outbreak of deadly African swine fever and called on the entire nation to join the fight against the rapidly spreading disease.The virus had spread to 48 of the country's 63 provinces, agriculture minister Nguyen Xuan Cuong said at a meeting of parliament, upping the number of pigs culled from 1.7 million less than a week ago.Pork accounts for three-quarters of total meat consumption in Vietnam, a country of 95 million people where most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically.\"This is an extremely dangerous disease ... and we have to take the fight seriously,\" Cuong said. \"The whole political system has to get engaged in the fight.\"Cuong also called on local consumers not to turn their back on pork consumption and encouraged businesses to stockpile pork in anticipation of shortages in the second half of the year.\"We shouldn't expand the pig herd at the moment, but instead, shift the focus on expanding cattle, poultry and aquaculture production,\" he added.Vietnam's pork industry is valued at around 94 trillion dong ($4 billion or 437 billion yen), accounting for nearly 10 percent of the country's agricultural sector.Cuong said the outbreak is threatening to expand to the rest of the country as the virus remains dormant in the environment for a long time and can spread through complex and varied means.African swine fever was first detected in Asia last August in China, the world's largest pork producer, where Rabobank has estimated up 200 million pigs could be culled or die. Other analysts do not expect such a large impact.South Korea said on Friday the disease has been detected in North Korea near it's border with China.Earlier this month, Vietnam said it will mobilize its military and police forces to help combat the outbreak.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in March advised Vietnam to declare the swine fever outbreak as a national emergency.", "Tiananmen vets look back on movement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistakes, passion,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,31,2019": "BEIJING--Wu'er Kaixi was among the most outspoken of the student leaders during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, famously reproaching then-Premier Li Peng at a meeting broadcast on national television.Three decades on, he's more circumspect but remains just as harsh a critic of the Communist regime and just as committed to bringing democracy to China.While many former leaders and participants in the protests have moved on, embracing lives and careers that have little direct relation to the movement, others remain wedded to the cause, either by vocation, through survivors' guilt or because their actions permanently put them on the wrong side of the authorities. They remain determined to keep the memories alive even as China's rulers seek to sandblast the protests and the military's bloody crackdown from history.\"Sometimes remembrance is one of the most humble forms of resistance,\" Wu'er Kaixi said in an interview in Taiwan, where he now lives with his wife and children.While Wu'er Kaixi, 51, escaped abroad after the June 4 crackdown after finding himself at No. 2 on the government's most-wanted list, then-graduate student Pu Zhiqiang remained in China despite his role in the protests as a high-profile advocate of speech and press freedoms. Looking at old photos of his younger self, Pu reflects on the motivations of the protesters that were mostly pure, if somewhat naive.\"We hoped that China could change for the better,\" said Pu, 54. \"As a 24-year-old, presented with this chance to serve society, had I not played a role at all, not made my voice heard, I would not have been able to forgive myself.\"While many who took part wonder what could have been done differently to avoid the bloodshed, Feng Congde, a graduate student that year at elite Peking University, is convinced the students didn't push hard enough.The experience of 1989 was \"both positive and negative,\" Feng said. \"But we have to learn the lesson, that even though we had these large numbers of people on the street, we didn't know what we should do. We should have asked the military to overthrow the regime.\"Feng maintains that now, as back then, the regime remains resistant to reforming itself in the way that Taiwan's Nationalists evolved from an authoritarian police state into a multiparty democracy, eventually handing over power to the opposition through elections. Like many in the democratic movement, Feng idolizes Chiang Ching-kuo, the son and successor of Chiang Kai-shek, who began the process of Taiwan's democratization during the 1980s.\"I'm quite optimistic about the democratic future of China, but I have very little hope that (President and Communist Party leader) Xi Jinping can learn from Chiang Ching-kuo. I think the totalitarian (Communist Party) regime is totally different from an authoritarian regime like the (Nationalists),\" Feng said.While few echo Feng's ruing of the lost chance of a military coup, hostility toward the regime and frustration with perceived foreign gullibility are near constants among members of the movement who remain active, especially those based abroad. Their impressions appear permanently colored by the shock, horror and disbelief they felt when the People's Liberation Army opened fire on the people they'd been charged with protecting and who'd grown to trust and revere them.Wang Dan, 50, who was imprisoned after being named No. 1 on the most-wanted list, is among those who doesn't mince words.\"It is time for us now, for the whole democratic countries now, to re-recognize the true face of the (Communist Party) and try to learn some lessons from the Tiananmen massacre,\" Wang said, using another term for the crackdown of June 3-4. \"This is a very important challenge for the whole world, because now China is a rising power, and seems like a threat for the democracy and freedom of the whole world.\"Wu'er Kaixi is similarly scathing, deriding the regime's claims to patriotic zeal as a cover for their desire to maintain their wealth and privileges at any cost.\"Let's look at what the Chinese regime is clearly. It's a group of people who stole the position of ruling China, one of the largest counties in the world and they're taking advantage of that position to do one thing: loot,\" he said.Pu, a lawyer who was disbarred for his political activism, bemoans 1989 and the years since as a lost opportunity to develop a new, possibly alternative, political class.Tiananmen \"was an excellent training opportunity for taking part in society, taking part in politics for young people of my generation,\" Pu said. \"But the distinctive characteristic of Chinese politics--this long-term totalitarianism--is that it cannot permit a political force or political party to take organized action.\"Things have grown only more difficult amid tightening social controls, making it much harder to rally forces in society to do things \"either good or bad,\" Pu said.Yet Wu'er Kaixi, now the honorary chairman of Reporters Without Borders at its East Asia office in Taipei, says those actions--the increasing repression borne out in policies such as the internment of 1 million or more Chinese Muslims in re-education camps--provide a constant reminder of the unchanged nature of the regime.\"The reason people still remember (1989), other than the mere importance of it, is also because the Communist Party is still conducting all of these brutal acts and atrocities within China against Uighur people, against Tibetans, Hong Kong, Macau, and even conducting threats against neighboring countries like Taiwan,\" he said.\"That will remind people that this regime, today's acts of this regime, is the same regime that massacred peaceful demonstrators 30 years ago,\" he said.Feng, who is studying acupuncture and administers pro-democracy websites, and Wu'er Kaixi say their continued zeal for the cause is bolstered by a sense of obligation to those who fell in 1989, to see their names rehabilitated and their goal of a democratic China achieve fruition.\"So I have to live with this survivor's guilt ... but I will try to make the dream of those who fell 30 years ago come true sooner,\" Wu'er Kaixi said.Pu, who continues to work as a legal adviser, said he sees his generation as a link to the past. Veterans, those around 50, are now the \"backbone of society\" who are obligated to pass on their experiences and ideals to a younger generation.Apart from the leaders, who to varying degrees have had some say in how they have lived their lives since, Tiananmen left many scarred for life or saddled with criminal records that have severely restricted their choices.Since serving a 17-year sentence for allegedly attacking martial law troops--a charge he denies--Dong Shengkun has been unable to find a steady job and is forced to live with his elderly mother while receiving the government's minimum living allowance of 1,000 yuan ($145) per month. Though he wishes to marry his girlfriend, the government would take away even that meager stipend were he to do so due to her somewhat better financial circumstances.Still, Dong, who picks up odd jobs for extra income, has no regrets for having joined in the protests out of a sense of outrage and desire for change.The 1989 movement \"was about justice,\" Dong said.", "Philippines ships 69 containers of garbage back to Canada,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,31,2019": "SUBIC, Philippines--The Philippines, one of two Southeast Asian countries that protested being treated like dumpsites by wealthier nations, on Friday shipped 69 containers of what its officials called illegally transported garbage back to Canada.Administrator Wilma Eisma of Subic Bay freeport said the tons of garbage were loaded overnight on the container ship M/V Bavaria, which left on a 20-day journey to the Canadian port city of Vancouver and ended a \"sordid chapter in our history.\" The Bavaria will stop at a Taiwanese port before heading to Canada, she said.Environmental activists, including those from Greenpeace and EcoWaste Coalition, welcomed the Bavaria's arrival at Subic Bay, and on Thursday sailed on board a small outrigger with a streamer reading, \"Philippines: not a garbage dumping ground!\"President Rodrigo Duterte had threatened to forcibly ship back the trash, which officials said was transported to the Philippines in 103 containers in 2013 to 2014, and falsely declared as recyclable plastic scraps. Several containers of the trash had been disposed of, including in a landfill, leaving 69 containers of electrical and household waste, including used diapers, rotting in two Philippine ports.The Philippine government recalled its ambassador and consuls in Canada earlier this month over Ottawa's failure to comply with a May 15 deadline to take back the waste.\"I think the message that we're sending to the world is that we will not be a pushover and, moreover, that the president is really somebody to reckon with,\" Eisma told The Associated Press.The return of the garbage removes a six-year thorn in relations between the two countries, especially under Duterte, a temperamental leader who took office in mid-2016. He has resented international criticism, including by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of his bloody crackdown on illegal drugs that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.The countries had sought to resolve the problem for years, with Trudeau saying in 2017 that legal issues preventing the return of the garbage had been resolved.The return, however, was delayed by other issues despite Canadian assurances of its willingness to take back the garbage that Trudeau said was shipped to Manila in a private commercial transaction.Last week, Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the government had awarded a contract to French shipping giant Bollore Logistics Canada, calling for the return of the containers by the end of June.But presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo rejected the plan, saying the Duterte administration would look for a private shipping company to transport the garbage sooner.\"If Canada will not accept their trash, we will leave the same within its territorial waters,\" Panelo said. \"The president's stance is as principled as it is uncompromising: The Philippines as an independent sovereign nation must not be treated as trash by other foreign nations.\"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has also criticized the practice of wealthier countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan sending their non-recyclable waste to poorer countries.Speaking in Tokyo on Thursday, Mahathir said it was \"grossly unfair\" and should stop. His comments came a few days after his government announced plans to return thousands of tons of plastic waste to mostly Western countries.China banned the import of plastic waste last year, causing other Southeast Asian nations to become new destinations.Philippine environmental groups urged the Duterte administration on Thursday to ban all imports of waste and ratify the Basel Ban Amendment, which prohibits the import of waste for any reason, including recycling. They cited the discovery of other waste shipments to the Philippines from South Korea in 2018 and more recently from Australia and Hong Kong.The garbage issue has been the latest strain in Philippine relations with Canada under Duterte. Last year, he canceled a multimillion-dollar agreement to buy 16 helicopters from Canada after Trudeau's government decided to review the deal due to concerns that the Philippine military might use the aircraft in counterinsurgency assaults.", "Hong Kong judges say proposed extradition changes risky,REUTERS,May,29,2019": "HONG KONG--Some Hong Kong judges fear they are being put on a collision course with Beijing as the special administrative region's government pushes for sweeping legal changes that would for the first time allow fugitives captured in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial.Three senior judges and 12 leading commercial and criminal lawyers say the changes, called the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance amendment bill, mark one of the starkest challenges to Hong Kong's legal system and are increasingly troubling its business, political and diplomatic communities.It is the first time judges--who by convention don't comment on political or legislative matters--have discussed the issue publicly.The city's independent legal system was guaranteed under the laws governing Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule 22 years ago and is seen by the financial hub's business and diplomatic communities as its strongest remaining asset amid encroachments from Beijing. Hong Kong's extensive autonomy is guaranteed until 2047.The judges and lawyers say that under Hong Kong's British-based common law system, extraditions are based on the presumption of a fair trial and humane punishment in the receiving country--a core trust they say China's Communist Party-controlled legal system has not earned.\"These amendments ignore the importance of that trust--and in the case of the mainland, it simply doesn't exist,\" one highly experienced judge told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\"Many of us see this as unworkable,\" the judge said. \"And we are deeply disturbed.\"Led by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, local officials have limited public consultation on the amendments and are pushing hard for the city's legislative body to pass the changes before it breaks for summer in July, saying long-standing \"loopholes\" need to be plugged.Lam's office declined to comment directly, referring questions to the security bureau. On Tuesday, she told reporters that the government would consider calls for more safeguards.Hong Kong's Security Bureau said in a response to Reuters that only after all \"human rights and procedural safeguards\" had been satisfied, and the requesting jurisdiction has \"pledged to those safeguards,\" would any extradition case be put to the courts.The proposed changes provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.The amendments allow for the chief executive to both seek the arrest of a fugitive and sign off on their extradition once approved by the courts, including any appeals and judicial reviews.But they also eliminate the oversight roles of the chief executive's Cabinet and the city's legislative body, which can currently step in to evaluate extradition arrangements.Lam and her administration have repeatedly stressed that there are provisions to stop people from being persecuted for political crimes, religious beliefs or being put at risk of torture. They have highlighted the role of Hong Kong's judiciary as gatekeepers and guardians.However, some judges say China's increasingly close relationship with Hong Kong and the limited scope of extradition hearings would leave them little room to maneuver. They worry that if they tried to stop high-profile suspects from being sent across the border, they would be exposed to criticism and political pressure from Beijing.Conversely, they say, if they approve contentious extradition requests, local critics may accuse the judges of merely doing Beijing's bidding, denting perceptions of independence.China's Justice Ministry declined to comment.The Hong Kong Bar Association, business groups such as the American Chamber of Commerce, and several foreign governments, including the United States, have voiced concerns about the changes undermining Hong Kong's rule of law.In extradition cases, judges in Hong Kong have little role beyond establishing, through documentary evidence, that the requesting country has a legitimate case. They cannot establish guilt and do not routinely weigh the evidence or cross-examine the foreign prosecutors.Those features will not change under the proposed amendments.But a statement from 12 current and former chairs of the city's barristers' association warns that the government's \"oft-repeated assertion that the judges will be gatekeepers is misleading.\"\"It is not, and never has been, the function of the Courts ... to consider the legal system and procedure of the foreign jurisdiction,\" it said.\"The proposed new legislation does not give the Court power to review such matters and the Court would be in no such position to do so.\"Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor wrote a joint letter to Lam in March warning that China's justice system had a record of arbitrary detention, torture, and violations of rights to a fair trial.Rights lawyer Michael Vidler spoke of a deepening concern across the legal community.\"It's going to have a dramatic chilling effect,\" Vidler said. \"The damage to Hong Kong's reputation as a free and safe place where the rule of law is upheld is incalculable.\"If the amendments are passed, any person in Hong Kong, whether a local resident or a foreign passport holder, can be extradited. The 37 extraditable offenses include murder, sexual offenses, kidnapping, corruption, money laundering, fraud and smuggling.China's laws allow it to charge Chinese nationals with crimes committed outside the country, meaning they could be arrested in Hong Kong for actions committed internationally.For all offenses, the punishment threshold is at least three years, and no extradition involving the death penalty would be allowed. Under Hong Kong law, the crime for which someone is being extradited must be a crime in Hong Kong as well as the requesting country.Geoffrey Ma, the Chief Justice of Hong Kong, declined to comment about the proposed amendments.Some judges, leading lawyers and diplomats acknowledge the need for extraditions to the mainland in the long term, but say improvements to the Chinese system and a negotiated treaty with broad consultation and tougher safeguards would be needed.Professor Simon Young of the University of Hong Kong's law school said Hong Kong's separate legal system needed to be better defined ahead of the 2047 deadline. It therefore makes sense to implement a clear and robust extradition arrangement with the mainland, he said.For instance, he said, the existing provisions for the Legislative Council to review extradition requests should be included.\"If done properly, it could help Hong Kong maintain its distinct system ... the key will be having adequate safeguards in place,\" Young said. \"That doesn't seem to be case now, and more consultation is needed.\"", "Chinese tourism to U.S. drops for 1st time in 15 years,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,28,2019": "After more than a decade of rapid growth, Chinese travel to the United States is falling. And that has cities, malls and other tourist spots scrambling to reverse the trend.Travel from China to the United States fell 5.7 percent in 2018 to 2.9 million visitors, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, which collects data from U.S. Customs forms. It was the first time since 2003 that Chinese travel to the United States slipped from the prior year.Friction between the United States and China is one reason for the slowdown. The Trump administration first imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines in January 2018, and the trade war has escalated from there. The United States now has a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion (22 trillion yen) worth of Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. imports.Last summer, China issued a travel warning for the United States, telling its citizens to beware of shootings, robberies and high costs for medical care. The United States shot back with its own warning about travel to China.Wang Haixia, who works at an international trade company in Beijing, traveled to the United States in May for her sister's graduation. She and her family planned to spend 10 days in Illinois and New York.Wang says she might have stayed longer but doesn't want to contribute to the U.S. economy amid the trade war.\"I cannot cancel this trip because I promised my sister I would go to her commencement,\" she said. \"My relatives will contribute more than 100,000 yuan to America just staying for 10 days, and that's enough.\"There are other reasons behind the slowdown. Economic uncertainty in China has travelers at the lower end of the market vacationing closer to home, says Wolfgang Georg Arlt, director of the Chinese Outbound Tourism Research Institute, which found that 56 percent of travelers leaving China in the last three months of 2018 went to Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan compared with 50 percent in 2017. Those who do travel farther are seeking out more exotic destinations like Croatia, Morocco and Nepal.Chinese travel to the United States had already been moderating from its breakneck pace earlier this decade. In 2000, 249,000 Chinese visited the United States. That tripled to 802,000 by 2010, then tripled again by 2015, in part because of higher incomes, better long-haul flight connections and an easing of visa restrictions, according to McKinsey, the consulting firm.The United States welcomed more than 3 million Chinese visitors in 2016 and 2017. But year-over-year growth edged up just 4 percent in 2017, the slowest pace in more than a decade.Most industry-watchers agree that any downturn is temporary, since China's middle class will only continue to expand. The U.S. government forecasts Chinese tourism will grow 2 percent this year to 3.3 million visitors, and will reach 4.1 million visitors in 2023.\"Even if the Chinese economy cools, it's still going to continue to be a very good source of growth for the travel industry,\" said David Huether, senior vice president of research for the U.S. Travel Association.In general, international travel to the United States has been declining. Overall data for 2018 hasn't been released yet, but international travel fell 2 percent in 2016 and was flat in 2017.But because China commands some of the highest tourism traffic to the United States, any falloff will be felt by destinations that have come to rely on Chinese spending power. In 2017, the country had the fifth highest number of U.S.-bound tourists, behind Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Japan. Ten years earlier, China wasn't even on the top 10 list, falling behind countries like Germany, France, South Korea and Australia, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.China didn't crack the top 10 list until 2011 and has been climbing ever since. Spending by Chinese visitors--which doesn't include students--ballooned more than 600 percent between 2008 and 2016, to nearly $18.9 billion. In 2017, that fell by 1 percent to $18.8 billion, or about 12 percent of overall tourism spending.To hold onto those dollars, experts say the tourism industry must do more to keep up with Chinese travelers and their changing needs.Larry Yu, a professor of hospitality management at George Washington University, notes that Chinese tourists--particularly younger ones--are increasingly planning trips using social media apps like WeChat and are less likely to book through big tour groups. They have also rapidly adopted smartphone-based payment systems.Destinations should invest in those technologies now if they want to continue attracting Chinese tourists, says David Becker, former CEO of Attract China, a New York-based travel consultancy.\"A lot of companies looked at the Chinese market as easy money, but we have to be relevant to the Chinese,\" Becker said. Attract China, for instance, has helped luxury stores in Manhattan incorporate Jeenie, a live translation app, and add Alipay and WeChat Pay for mobile payments.Others have also been stepping up their efforts. The Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles used to cater to busloads of Chinese tourists. Now, it's focusing on small groups of less than 10 VIP shoppers, says Susan Vance, the mall's marketing and sponsorship director. The mall has also pushed stores to offer China UnionPay, a digital payment service. More than 100 stores now have it, Vance says, up from three in 2014.Tourism officials are also catching onto WeChat. In late 2017, Washington, D.C., became the first U.S. city to launch an interactive guide in the app. Chinese travelers can use it to get directions to attractions, access audio tours in Mandarin and find dining and shopping. The city's marketing office has one staff member dedicated to WeChat.Washington also recently launched a Welcome China program that teaches hotels, restaurants and other venues about Chinese customs and encourages them to offer things like Chinese-language menus or in-room slippers. Forty-four hotels and a handful of restaurants have signed on.Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, the city's marketing office, said the number of Chinese tourists visiting Washington doubled in the last five years before falling slightly in 2017. But Ferguson, who traveled to China last month to meet with tourism officials, said there's still significant interest in travel to the United States.\"We're beefing up our efforts because we see there's so much potential for growth,\" he said.", "Thousands in Hong Kong commemorate 1989 Tiananmen protests,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,27,2019": "HONG KONG--More than 2,000 people marched in Hong Kong on Sunday to mark 30 years since a pro-democracy protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square ended in bloodshed.Demonstrators took to the streets holding yellow umbrellas that read \"Support Freedom, Oppose Evil Laws.\" Some people carried a black coffin, while others wheeled white crosses and the numbers 6 and 4--a nod to the day on June 4, 1989, when leaders of China's ruling Communist Party ordered the military to re-take Tiananmen Square from student-led protesters.Hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters and onlookers were killed late on June 3 and in the early hours of June 4 as a result of the martial action.Commemorations of the historic event are strictly banned in mainland China, and those who attempt to raise awareness of or merely discuss it are often punished by authorities. Groups such as the \"Tiananmen Mothers\" are pressured to stay quiet about the children they lost, while others are detained for making even subtle tributes to the occasion.The semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong, however, holds yearly vigils and other gatherings to remember the deceased and pay tribute to the spirit of the protests.This year in Hong Kong, the march took on additional significance as opposition to changes to an extradition law widely seen as eroding the territory's independent legal system.Revisions to the law would make it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where critics say they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.\"Recently, we are facing the challenge of this (extradition law), which affects our basic freedom and liberty,\" said Albert Ho, who organized Sunday's march. He is chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China.\"The dedication and the commitment to fight for democracy and human rights is the only way out,\" said Ho, who added that he hopes more people will become aware of the situation facing Hong Kong as legislators debate the proposed amendments.", "Taiwan celebrates Asia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1st same-sex marriages as couples wed,REUTERS,May,24,2019": "TAIPEI--Same-sex couples tied the knot in emotional scenes in Taiwan on Friday, the first legal marriages in Asia hailed by activists as a social revolution for the region.Taiwan's parliament passed a bill last week that endorsed same-sex marriage, although the measure could complicate President Tsai Ing-wen's bid for re-election next year.More than 160 same-sex couples married on Friday, according to government data, after years of heated debate over marriage equality that has divided the self-ruled and democratic island.Twenty couples queued to tie the knot at a marriage registration office in downtown Taipei, where rainbow flags were on display alongside stacks of government-issued, rainbow-themed registration forms.\"I feel very lucky that I can say this out loud to everyone: I am gay and I am getting married,\" said Shane Lin, a 31-year-old baker who with his partner were the first couple to register in the Taipei office.\"I am extremely proud of my country Taiwan,\" said a tearful Lin.The euphoria and emotion among the island's gay community was on display as newlywed couples walked down a rainbow-colored carpet in a nearby park, watched by families and friends as well as diplomats and reporters.Chi Chia-wei, an activist who brought a case to Taiwan's constitutional court that led to a landmark court ruling on same-sex marriage in 2017, congratulated the couples.\"This is the right that we deserved from a long time ago,\" he said, draped in a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the colors of the international gay movement.\"As a beacon in Asia, I hope Taiwan's democracy and human rights could have a ripple effect on other countries in Asia,\" he added.Supporters also celebrated on social media, sharing posts with the rainbow colors of the gay rights movement.Friday's celebration followed a years-long tussle over marriage equality that culminated in the 2017 declaration by the constitutional court giving same-sex couples the right to marry, and setting a deadline of May 24 for legislation.Marriage equality was backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but the measure could complicate President Tsai's bid for a second term in elections next year.Conservative groups that oppose same-sex marriage said the legislation disrespected the people's will.Same-sex marriage is not recognized by Hong Kong and neighboring China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province to be returned to the fold by force, if necessary.It marks another milestone in Taiwan's development as one of the region's more liberal societies, in contrast with China's strongly autocratic government.Across the strait, many Chinese congratulated Taiwan's newlywed same-sex couples on platforms such as Weibo, China's version of Twitter.\"For once I thought the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan would impact on the Chinese government, making them heed our appeals,\" one Weibo user said.\"But then I found the shock actually makes the government more scared, stepping up their crackdown on us.\"", "U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,REUTERS,May,22,2019": "SHANGHAI/ NEW YORK--The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China's Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world's largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world's two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.The two countries increased import tariffs on each other's goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.Shares of U.S. suppliers to Huawei including Qualcomm, Intel Corp. and Lumentum Holdings Inc. rose on Tuesday morning, with the Philadelphia Chip Index up more than 1%.Radio frequency chipmaker Qorvo was the latest U.S. supplier after mobile parts maker Lumentum to halt shipments to Huawei.It is unclear what the U.S. government extension permits, but if it allows Huawei to keep purchasing components, the company will likely order more to build inventory, said Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.\"The U.S. government's actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,\" Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei's supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.China's yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.President Xi Jinping's Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.\"Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,\" Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump's claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.Huawei is currently on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet Inc.'s Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm's smartphones that run on Google's Android operating system.Monday's temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.\"Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone's best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei's prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years.China was nevertheless still \"far behind\" the United States in technology, he said.Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be \"hard to replace\".Nearly 16 percent of Huawei's spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology, analysts said.Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple Inc.'s iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm's devices to family members.\"Apple has a good business ecosystem ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.\"U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said.", "Hong Kong leader presses on with extradition bill called \u00e2\u0080\u0098evil\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,May,21,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's leader said on Tuesday that her administration was determined to push through an extradition bill that could see individuals sent back to mainland China for trial, despite mounting opposition locally and internationally.The proposed legislation has stoked mass protests in the former British colony, which was promised a high degree of autonomy under a \"one country, two systems\" formula when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.On Monday, the government said it would bypass legislative procedure to expedite the passage of amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which the U.S. State Department last week described as threatening the rule of law in Hong Kong.Opponents had disrupted a succession of legislative sessions meant to scrutinize the bill, with brawls breaking out in the legislative council.\"Valuable time for deliberation has been lost,\" Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters.\"The most serious issue is that we couldn't see a way forward, how to break this deadlock other than to force me to scrap this bill, but this is unrealistic,\" she told reporters.She said the bill would now be sent directly to the full legislature on June 12 for a second reading, to try to pass it before the legislature's summer recess.If the bill is passed, Hong Kong would allow, for the first time, ad hoc extradition requests to countries with no existing extradition treaties, including places like Taiwan, and crucially, mainland China.Taiwan has said the bill would extend China's reach into Hong Kong, putting at risk any Taiwanese who pass through the city.The Hong Kong government insists the extradition law has safeguards to protect human rights, including the need for all extradition requests to be approved by a local court.During the past week, Beijing has hardened its stance, with senior officials saying the law was urgently needed, though Lam said the initial push for the law had come from her government.Criticism has also poured in from the business, legal, media and diplomatic communities in Hong Kong.More large protests are expected, including on June 4, when the city hosts an annual candlelight vigil for victims of a bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.Lam Cheuk-ting, an opposition Democratic Party lawmaker, criticized the government's move to fast-track the \"evil law.\"Lawmakers may still be able to propose amendments to the bill, but critics say the government can choose not to adopt them, given backing from a pro-Beijing majority in the legislature.Pro-democracy media magnate Jimmy Lai, who runs Hong Kong's tabloid Apple Daily newspaper, said in a talk at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club that the law's implications were grave.\"In one swoop it finishes Hong Kong. It's a massacre of our freedom, of our legal system, of the free press. Everything,\" Lai said.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pig disease outbreak pushes up global pork prices,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,20,2019": "BEIJING--Hong Kong retiree Lee Wai-man loves pork fresh from the market but eats a lot less now that the price has jumped 40 percent as China's struggle with outbreaks of a deadly swine disease sends shock waves through global meat markets.China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork, but output is plunging as Beijing destroys herds and blocks shipments to stop African swine fever. Importers are filling the gap by buying pork as far away as Europe, boosting prices and causing shortages in other markets.\"I'm a fresh-pork lover, but it's too expensive,\" Lee, 87, said as she shopped at a Hong Kong market.African swine fever doesn't harm humans but is fatal and spreads quickly among pigs. It was first reported in August in China's northeast. Since then, 1 million pigs have died and the disease has spread to 31 of China's 34 provinces, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.The outbreak's scale is unprecedented, said Dirk Pfeiffer, a veterinary epidemiologist at the City University of Hong Kong.\"This is probably the most complex animal disease we have ever had to deal with,\" Pfeiffer said.China's shortfall is likely to be so big it will match Europe's annual pork output and exceed U.S. production by 30 percent, industry researchers say.\"Everyone wants to import as much pork as possible,\" said industry analyst Angela Zhang of IQC Insights. She said the trend is likely to accelerate as Chinese production falls.That's a boost for farmers in Germany, Spain and other countries with healthy pigs but hard on families in Southeast Asia and other poor markets that rely on pork for protein.This year's Chinese pork output might fall by up to 35 percent, according to Rabobank, a Dutch bank.Global supplies will be \"redirected to China,\" the bank's researchers said in an April report. It said the \"unprecedented shift\" in trade will likely cause shortages in other markets.Grocery shoppers in Germany, Japan and other high-income markets grumble at paying more for kielbasa or tonkatsu, but short supplies are a serious concern in places such as Cambodia where pork is the only meat many families can afford.Cambodia's live hog price jumped 37 percent in the past six months, according to Srun Pov, president of the Cambodia Livestock Raiser Association. He said the country is buying about 30 percent of its daily needs of 500-600 tons from Thailand.\"Pork is important to us,\" said Chhe Pich as a butcher weighed her purchase in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. \"Even though the current price is a bit high, I have to buy it to serve my family.\"The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects China's pork imports to soar 41 percent this year over 2018 to 2.2 million tons. There's no immediate end in sight as \"evidence mounts that China will be unable to eradicate ASF in the near-term,\" it said in a recent report.The jolt to the global meat industry highlights China's voracious demand for food for its 1.4 billion people, the potential for wider disruptions if its own production falters and its growing ability to outbid other customers for supplies.African swine fever was first reported in August in China's northeast. Since then, 1 million pigs have died and the disease has spread to 31 of China's 34 provinces, according to the FAO.Outbreaks have been reported in Cambodia, Mongolia, South Africa and Vietnam.It's been found among a small number of wild boars, which can spread the disease, in Russia and seven European countries.Yang Wenguo, a farmer in Jiangjiaqiao, a village a two-hour drive northeast of Beijing, said he has lost 800 pigs. He now has a few dozen.Most of Yang's pens are empty. White pus drips from blood-shot eyes of one surviving hog. Foam drips from another's mouth. Smaller pigs cough.Yang dosed his animals with government-subsidized medications but they kept getting sick. The government hauls away dead animals and pays compensation of 1,000 yuan ($145 or 15,910 yen) for a sow and 20 yuan ($3) for a piglet.\"You buy pigs, then they all die,\" he said, walking on ground covered in disinfectant that looks like dirty snow. Only about 60 to 70 pigs remain from total herds of about 3,000 in Jiangjiaqiao.Four other families in the village that raised pigs have stopped, Yang said, \"No one can bear losing all the pigs they raise.\" He'd like to sell his farm and find work in the city but no one wants to buy.The USDA forecasts China's total hog herd will shrink by 18 percent this year to 350 million animals, the lowest level since the 1980s.In Hong Kong, authorities destroyed 6,000 pigs at one slaughterhouse after an animal imported from the mainland was found to be infected.\"More and more customers are switching from roast pork to other roast meat like chicken and duck,\" said restaurant owner Siu Si-man.Chinese authorities respond to outbreaks by temporarily banning shipments of pigs from any province where a case is reported.That has caused retail prices to spike in big cities cut off from supplies. Prices paid to farmers have collapsed in areas with a surplus of pigs they can't export.A half-hour drive from Yang's farm, Wang Lijun breeds his own piglets to avoid buying infected animals. His herd shrank from 160 to 170 animals to about 20 to 30 but none died this year.\"All farmers are cutting production,\" he said, walking past a row of cages holding pregnant sows.The number of sows needed for breeding had fallen 19 percent from a year ago by the end of February, which suggests supply will plunge through next year, the USDA forecasts.\"China's herd-rebuilding will be slow and take years,\" said Rabobank.In Vietnam, the government said in mid-May that 1.2 million pigs, or about 5 percent of its total herds, had died or been destroyed. Rabobank expects Vietnamese pork production to fall 10 percent this year from 2018.China's biggest foreign pork supplier is Spain, which accounts for 20 percent of imports. Germany supplies 19.5 percent and Canada 16 percent.Spanish exports of pork and other pig products to China jumped 32.8 percent in the first two months of 2019 from a year earlier to 117 million euros ($131 million or 14 billion yen), according to Interporc, a Spanish industry group.\"My suppliers have told me that they are going to raise prices at the end of the month because of what is happening in China,\" said Jordi Nargares, a butcher in a working class neighborhood of Barcelona.U.S. pork sales to China have been disrupted by Beijing's tariff war with the Trump administration over trade and technology.Chinese buyers canceled orders for 3,300 tons of American pork the week of May 6, according to the USDA.Chinese companies are investing in farms and food processors abroad to capitalize on strong demand.

We need more dialogue in society.\"Conservative groups that oppose same-sex marriage said the legislation disrespected the people's will.\"The will of some seven million people in the referendum has been trampled,\" one group, the Coalition for the Happiness of Our Next Generation said in a statement. \"The massive public will strike back in 2020.\"Australia passed laws allowing same-sex marriage in 2017, but such unions are not recognized by Hong Kong and neighboring China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province to be brought back into the fold by force if necessary.", "Hong Kong court sends protest leader back to jail as \u00e2\u0080\u0098deterrent\u00e2\u0080\u0099,REUTERS,May,17,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's Court of Appeal sent a young leader of the Chinese-ruled city's 2014 \"Umbrella\" pro-democracy street protests back to jail on Thursday for contempt of court, ruling out any motive other than ensuring a \"deterrent sentence.\"Joshua Wong, 22, was sentenced to three months in jail in January last year for disobeying a court order and not leaving a protest zone during the rallies that blocked major roads in the Chinese-ruled city for nearly three months.The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction but reduced his jail sentence to two months, citing his young age as a reason. He had earlier served six days before being released pending the appeal.Wong, then just 17, was at the forefront of the broad civil disobedience movement that presented China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Communist Party rulers in Beijing with one of their biggest political challenges in decades, accused by many of interference in Hong Kong's affairs.\"It is an affront to the court and must be met with a deterrent sentence,\" the three judges said in a written summary.\"Any suggestion that he is punished because of his status or notoriety as a committed social activist or any other reason, whatever it might be, is entirely baseless and misconceived.\"As guards led Wong away, he shouted: \"Everyone keep going!\" Dozens of supporters in the public gallery cheered back in response.Dozens more had gathered outside the court building, some waving yellow umbrellas--the symbol of the 2014 protests.Both Wong and his supporters also called for the scrapping of Hong Kong government proposals to remove long-standing blocks on extraditing wanted suspects from Hong Kong to countries with which the city has no extradition agreements--including mainland China.\"Even though they can lock up our bodies, they can't lock up our minds,\" Wong said as he entered court to hear the verdict.Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech, but critics accuse Beijing of increasing pressure on the freewheeling global financial hub.Wong's sentence comes as concerns widen over the extradition amendments, uniting some opposition, business and legal groups as well as Western governments.More street protests are expected in coming weeks, with some seeing the extradition plans as the latest sign of Beijing's interference. China's main representative \"Liaison Office\" in Hong Kong said in a statement on Wednesday that the extradition law was urgently needed and had a sound legal foundation.In a related case in February last year, Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest court freed Wong and two other leaders in a stark reversal of an earlier jail sentence, but warned against future acts of dissent.", "ANALYSIS/ Blacklist mess: Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $105 billion business at stake after U.S. broadside,REUTERS,May,17,2019": "HONG KONG/ BEIJING--The latest U.S. broadside against Huawei that puts the Chinese firm on an exports blacklist threatens to rattle the global tech supply chain, linked closely to the $105 billion business of the world's top supplier of telecoms network equipment.The Trump administration has said it would add Huawei Technologies and 70 affiliates to its \"Entity List\"--a move that will likely ban the firm from acquiring U.S. components and technology without government approval, adding another incendiary element to the U.S.-China trade war.The ban is not yet effective.A similar U.S. ban on China's ZTE Corp had almost crippled business for the smaller Huawei rival early last year before the curb was lifted.Such sanctions on Huawei are, however, likely to have ramifications beyond the company itself, analysts said.It would disrupt Huawei's business at a minimum and all but put it out of business in an extreme, while its U.S. suppliers would also be hit, they said.Out of $70 billion Huawei spent for component procurement in 2018, some $11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc., and they could see that revenue disappear.On the other hand, U.S. companies like Apple face the risk of severe retaliation from China, a key market.\"This is going to be very messy,\" a China-based source at a U.S. tech company said.It will be tough for Huawei too, the person said, noting none of its U.S. suppliers \"can be replaced by Chinese ones, not within a few years, at least. By then, they are already dead.\"Revenue for the company, also the world's second-biggest maker of smartphones, touched 721 billion yuan ($105 billion) last year, eight times ZTE's and half the annual sales of South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.But its business has come under pressure over the past year given mounting international scrutiny, led by U.S. allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, a concern the company has said is unfounded.A range of Asian and European suppliers would also be hurt if Huawei was forced to curb production, while telecom carriers that rely on Huawei, and have largely resisted U.S. calls to bar the company, would be left scrambling just as countries race to roll out next-generation 5G mobile networks.\"Huawei being unable to manufacture network servers, for example, because they can't get key U.S. components would mean they also stop buying parts from other countries altogether,\" said an executive at a Huawei chip supplier.\"They can relatively better manage component sourcing for mobile phones because they have their own component businesses for smartphones. But server and network, it's a different story,\" the executive said.According to brokerage Jefferies, the sanctions would mean a \"nightmare for China's 5G\" too. The country, which is targeting a nationwide rollout next year, will very likely slow down its 5G push as a result, it added.However, industry participants pointed out that Huawei had been stockpiling components such as chips to ease disruptions.Its initial target was to build inventories of six to nine months, and it has recently been raised to 12 and, in some cases, 24 months, Jefferies said.Shares in Huawei suppliers fell across in Asia on the news of the U.S. blacklist.South Korea's Samsung dropped 2.4%, SK Hynix fell 3.5%, while China's Luxshare Precision Industry fell as much as 6.1%. Shares in ZTE also tumbled.Huawei has said it is \"ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security\".Its rotating Chairman Eric Xu also told Reuters in a recent interview that \"in case of unforeseen events ... we definitely have our contingency plan. What we have prepared has already been used in some of our products in the Chinese market.\"Huawei has spearheaded China's campaign to develop its own high-end technologies to reduce reliance on imports and such efforts have taken on urgency after U.S. sanctions on ZTE.The ZTE case led to some \"benefits\" and \"external pressures have developed into internal drivers\" in China, said Wan Gang, vice chairman of China's parliamentary advisory body.The pain for Huawei's supply chain would be redoubled if the trade war put a damper on the Chinese technology industry.\"The bigger concern would be U.S. allies that used to buy Huawei's components may not continue businesses with Huawei, because of fear of possibly upsetting the United States,\" said Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities in Seoul.The Trump administration's rhetoric toward China had cooled in recent days after another round of tariffs between the world's top two economies and a selloff on global stock markets.Tensions escalated on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring American companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms deemed to pose a national security risk.While the president's order did not specifically name any country or company, U.S. officials have previously labelled Huawei a \"threat.\"\"The U.S. seems to have already decided to nail Huawei down,\" said the China-based U.S. tech company source.\"The problem is that because there doesn't seem to be a prospect for a trade deal in the near future, the U.S. has expedited the process of killing Huawei.\"", "Empty resort housing units hand keys over to private lodgers,By SHIN MATSUURA/ Staff Writer,May,14,2019": "YUZAWA, Niigata Prefecture--When apartment units began to be rented out as a private lodging service at Angel Resort Yuzawa, residents expressed anxiety about the manners of non-Japanese guests.Arrangements were made so that, for example, private lodging guests from overseas are shown, when they check in, an explanatory video on a tablet computer on how to use the public bath and dispose of trash.So far there has been no major problem over manners, officials said.Private lodging rentals began at Angel Resort Yuzawa when Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Private Lodging Business Law took effect in June 2018, setting rules on similar practices.Twenty-one of the 131 apartment lots in the building are currently offered for private lodging. While most are studios measuring 28 square meters each, they also include two-bedroom lofts with a floor space of 65 square meters.The market surrounding resort apartments changed drastically between the beginning and end of the Heisei Era (1989-2019).When the era had just started, resort apartment buildings were sprouting up one after another under the asset-inflated economic growth of the time. Apartment units in them sold briskly.The \u00e2\u0080\u009cbubble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d however, popped, and low growth became the norm throughout the Heisei Era, during which time resort apartments never regained their one-time popularity.Today, both the properties and their owners are aging.Unidentifiable ownership, management fees in arrears, malfunctioning property management ... a negative chain of these and other circumstances has befallen lot owners and resident associations alike.Enter a new group of players, who may end that negative cycle and turn out to be the \u00e2\u0080\u009csaviors\u00e2\u0080\u009d of resort apartment buildings. They are non-Japanese visitors.Angel Resort Yuzawa is one of a number of resort apartment buildings that stand close to the Iwappara ski resort in Yuzawa.The building has two reception counters inside. The one closer to the entrance is reserved for apartment owners, whereas the one in the back is for private lodging guests.Before converting some of the units for private lodging, those apartments underwent remodeling. For example, kitchen ranges, which posed a risk of fire, were replaced by induction heaters.As expected, occupancy rates rose during the ski season from December through March. The lot occupancy rates typically hovered at around 50 percent during the past winter, although they differ from lot to lot, officials said.Japanese accounted for about 60 percent of the guests. The remaining 40 percent or so, or inbound visitors, were typically from Taiwan and Hong Kong.One of the lots, a studio, was remodeled at a cost of 734,000 yen ($6,590). It can accommodate up to five guests in a double bunk, with rates charged per room.Depending on supply and demand, the rate per night can be set anywhere within a broad range from 6,000 yen to 37,950 yen. The rates averaged 18,164 yen during the last ski season, with an occupancy rate of 50 percent.Angel Co., which oversees the management of Angel Resort Yuzawa, is in charge, among other things, of a check-in reception for private lodging guests and for changing sheets and towels.The guests are entitled to use common facilities of the building, including a public bath and a skiers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 locker room. They can also use, among other things, massage chairs, which are free of charge, and a ping-pong table, which is subject to charges.Under the current setup, the apartment owners are entitled to receive 30 percent of the accommodation fees.Some owners may be delighted to be receiving any income from their properties, which were previously only a drain on their finances, from management fees and fixed asset taxes. Others, however, may be unhappy that Angel is taking too high of a percentage.Some of the apartment owners who are not offering private lodging services may feel that private lodgers are availing themselves of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree ride\u00e2\u0080\u009d on their building\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common facilities.To appease the owners who are using their apartments, services available in common areas were upgraded when the private lodging started. For example, water from a natural hot spring was introduced to the public bath.That could be deemed a measure for improving lot occupancy rates for the benefit of all.The growing guest numbers have led officials to weigh reopening a closed restaurant on the second floor.The restaurant had an open, spacious feel, commanding a view of the Iwappara ski resort from a large window. During the asset-inflated economic growth of the late 1980s, reservations had to be made for the restaurant, but customers gradually drifted away, and the establishment was closed six to seven years ago.A crowd of resort apartment buildings popped up in Yuzawa when the asset-inflated economic growth coincided with a public skiing craze, thanks also to the convenient location of the town, which is served by a Shinkansen line and an expressway.The number of Japanese skiers has remained in decline significantly from that time. Instead, non-Japanese skiers are an increasing presence, and Yuzawa is no exception.Another property in the town has decided to rely on hotel services, instead of private lodging, to tap into the market of non-Japanese visitors.Angel Grandia Yuzawa-Nakazato is a luxury resort apartment building, whose units went on sale in 1992. It is now operated half as residences and half as a hotel.The decision to convert half of the property into hotel units inevitably came after many apartment units in the building went unsold after the bubble burst.The hotel section has been visited, over the past several years, by a growing number of non-Japanese skiers, many of them from the rest of Asia, officials said.Skiers do not account for all the growing number of non-Japanese visitors to Yuzawa. There is also an increasing number of non-Japanese workers who come to stay here for protracted periods and work here only during the winter.Every year, the number of foreign residents registered in Yuzawa swells from December through February and drops again by April. That trend has remained pronounced since four winters ago, and the numbers have risen from year to year.In February this year, the town had 310 foreign residents, about double the corresponding number three years ago, accounting for some 4 percent of the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population of 8,000 or so.Besides those who work seasonally for hotels and inns, there are also ski instructors who come from Hong Kong and Taiwan to stay in Yuzawa, where they give lessons to skiers from overseas, officials said, which results in foreign citizens drawing in more foreign nationals.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHokkaido, with its high-quality \u00e2\u0080\u0098powder snow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a favorite with non-Japanese skiers, but Yuzawa has its own advantages in the convenience of access from the Tokyo metropolitan area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hajime Ono, head of management with Angel, the apartment building management agency long involved in the management of resort apartment buildings here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA visit here can easily be combined with a sightseeing tour of Tokyo. Private lodgings for non-Japanese guests, for all their problems, could serve as an antidote for the oversupply of resort apartments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "Hong Kong legislators brawl over contentious extradition law,REUTERS,May,12,2019": "HONG KONG--Scuffles broke out in Hong Kong's legislature on Saturday between pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to Beijing over a proposed extradition law that will extend Beijing's powers over the China-ruled financial hub.One person was taken to hospital.The former British colony is trying to enact rules that would allow people accused of a crime, including foreigners, to be extradited from the city to countries without formal extradition agreements, including mainland China.Opponents fear the law would erode rights and legal protections in the free-wheeling financial hub that were guaranteed when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Tempers boiled over when pro-democracy lawmakers and the pro-Beijing majority tried to hold separate hearings on the bill. The democrats say the pro-China lawmakers breached rules in forming their own committee to try and ram through the legislation.Lawmakers clambered over tables, cursed and piled into each other as security personnel tried to maintain order.One pro-democracy lawmaker, Gary Fan, fell heavily and had to be stretchered to hospital. Several pro-Beijing lawmakers also fell, one needing a sling for his arm.\"It's a sad day for Hong Kong,\" said pro-establishment lawmaker Elizabeth Quat. \"We laughed at (scuffles in) Taiwan's legislature in the past, but Hong Kong's is even worse.\"The bill is the latest lightning rod for Hong Kong people worried about Beijing's powers over the city that was promised a high degree of autonomy under a \"one country, two systems\" formula when it returned to Chinese rule.More than 130,000 opponents of the bill marched against it two weeks ago, while several thousand gathered outside the legislature on Friday night to demand it be scrapped.Even Hong Kong's normally conservative business community has expressed opposition. The International Chamber of Commerce said the bill had \"gross inadequacies\".Hong Kong's Bar Association has said the law lacks sufficient safeguards for fair trial in mainland China.In the United States, a congressional commission said the law could extend China's \"coercive reach\" and create serious risks for U.S. security and business interests in Hong Kong.China rejected that saying Hong Kong affairs were an internal matter.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has insisted on the need for arrangements to extradite offenders to China and Taiwan, an island Beijing claims as its own, and other countries that do not have extradition treaties with the city.She has cited the case of a Hong Kong man who allegedly murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan last year, and who has since fled back to Hong Kong, as a major reason for rushing through the legislation with minimal public consultation.Yet Taiwan authorities have since said they opposed Hong Kong's extradition bill and will not agree to an ad hoc extradition arrangement for the murder suspect even if the bill passes.A spokesman for Hong Kong's authorities expressed \"utmost regret\" at the chaos in the legislature and urged lawmakers to \"resume rational discussions\".Chen Dong, deputy head of Beijing's main representative \"Liaison office\" in Hong Kong, said on Saturday the bill is needed to plug legal loopholes and \"improve Hong Kong's legal reputation\", according to the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao newspaper.Hong Kong's opposition democratic lawmakers hold less than a third of the seats in the legislature, meaning they cannot veto the bill when it goes to a final vote, possibly in the next few weeks.", "China still 'cautiously optimistic' on U.S. trade talks despite new tariffs,REUTERS,May,12,2019": "BEIJING/WASHINGTON--China and the United States have agreed to hold more trade talks in Beijing, Vice Premier Liu He said as U.S. President Donald Trump ordered his trade chief to begin the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China.Liu voiced a measured optimism on reaching a deal, but said there were \"issues of principle\" on which China would not back down.\"Negotiations have not broken down,\" Liu, China's chief negotiator in the talks, said in Washington on Friday, according to state television on Saturday. \"Quite the opposite, I think small setbacks are normal and inevitable during the negotiations of both countries. Looking forward, we are still cautiously optimistic,\" Liu said.Liu's optimism was tempered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told CNBC on Friday that there were no further talks with China planned \"as of now.\"Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday that he thinks China felt they were being \"beaten so badly\" in the recent negotiations that they may as well wait for the 2020 presidential election \"to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win--in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year.\"\"The only problem is that they know I am going to win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter, \"... and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\"The United States escalated a tariff war with China on Friday by hiking levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in the midst of last-ditch talks to rescue a trade deal. Trump had delayed the tariffs as negotiations between Washington and Beijing were progressing.On Friday, Trump issued orders for the tariff increase, saying China \"broke the deal\" by reneging on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.China strongly opposes the latest U.S. tariff hike, and as a nation, has to respond to that, Liu told a small group of Chinese reporters in the video clip.\"Right now, both sides have reached mutual understanding in many things, but frankly speaking, there are also differences. We think these differences are significant issues of principle,\" Liu said. \"We absolutely cannot make concessions on such issues of principle.\"He added that talks would continue in Beijing, but gave no details. Underscoring a lack of progress in the talks, Trump ordered a further escalation of tariffs.Trump's move would subject about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports to punitive tariffs, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on Friday. Lighthizer said a final decision has not been made on the new duties, which would come on top of an early Friday tariff rate increase, to 25% from 10%, on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.Three differences remain between the two countries, according to China's account of the latest talks.One of those is over tariffs, Liu said, according to a transcript of the Q&A published by Phoenix, a Hong Kong-based television station that is close to Beijing. China believes that tariffs were the genesis of the trade dispute, and that if both sides wanted to reach an agreement, then all tariffs must be eliminated, Liu said.The second is about procurement, on which an initial consensus was reached between the leaders of the two countries in Argentina late last year. The two sides now have differing views on the volumes, Liu said. The third is over how balanced the text of the draft agreement should be, he said.\"Every nation has its dignity, so the text ought to be balanced,\" Liu said.Sources told Reuters this week that China had deleted its commitments in the draft agreement that said it would change laws to resolve core complaints of the United States: theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets; forced technology transfers; competition policy; access to financial services; and currency manipulation.Liu denied the accusations of China's reneging on promises, saying China thought it was normal to make changes before a final deal. Both sides had differing views on how to phrase it, he said.Liu said he hoped this issue would be resolved, so it was unnecessary to \"over react\" to that point. Similar to Liu, Chinese state media said China would not give in on its core interests.\"China clearly requires that the trade procurement figures should be realistic; the text must be balanced and expressed in terms that are acceptable to the Chinese people and do not undermine the sovereignty and dignity of the country,\" the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary on Saturday.The trade war has weighed on the Chinese economy.When asked about domestic concerns over how the latest tariffs could further pressure the economy, Liu said he was optimistic about China's economy in the longer term, adding that it had entered an up-cycle after bottoming out somewhat last year.He said he believed the Chinese economy would maintain a stable and healthy trend despite some downward pressure, and that China had ample room for fiscal and monetary policy maneuvers.On Monday, hours after Trump said he intended to raise tariffs, the Chinese central bank cut the amount of reserves that some small and medium-sized banks need to hold, freeing up more funds for lending to cash-strapped firms.", "Car navigation system makers searching for road to success,By RYOKO TAKAHASHI/ Staff Writer,May,12,2019": "Car navigation systems have been a godsend to drivers in helping them find their way, but the manufacturers are now having a hard time charting their own course for the future.That may come as a surprise, since the systems have exemplified Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famously perfectionist manufacturing industries, complete with high-precision maps, route guide functions and beautiful displays.Manufacturers of these systems, however, have been facing a noticeably bumpier road in recent years. A glimpse into the background shows the cataclysmic change taking place in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s auto industry.A number of major players in the car navigation systems industry have recently come under the umbrella of major companies as all were struggling financially and finding it difficult to stay afloat on their own.In January, Alps Alpine Co. was born of a business integration between Alpine Electronics Inc., a leading player in the car navigation systems industry, and Alps Electric Co., a major electronic parts maker that was Alpine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest shareholder.Alps Electric, which had more than a 40-percent stake in Alpine, turned the latter into its wholly owned subsidiary. The arrangement was aimed at boosting technological development by combining Alpine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excellence in car navigation systems with Alps Electric\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technologies in producing auto parts, such as sensors and switches, officials said.In 2017, Fujitsu Ten Ltd., known for its \u00e2\u0080\u009cEclipse\u00e2\u0080\u009d car navigation systems, became a subsidiary to Denso Corp., a major auto parts maker affiliated with Toyota Motor Corp., and changed its name to Denso Ten Ltd.Clarion Co., which was a subsidiary to Hitachi Ltd., was acquired in March by Faurecia SA, a major French auto parts manufacturer, and had its shares delisted.And Pioneer Corp., known for its \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarrozzeria\u00e2\u0080\u009d imprint, in March also became a wholly owned subsidiary to a Hong Kong investment fund and had its shares delisted. Pioneer is hoping to have its business rehabilitated by receiving about 102 billion yen ($914.2 million) in financial assistance from the fund.Car navigation systems, found on many cars, are becoming increasingly advanced in their functions, including in their communication features. Demand for them is expected to grow further in an age when consumer electronic products will be going online, including under an \u00e2\u0080\u009cInternet of Things\u00e2\u0080\u009d setup.The market size is actually expanding.Figures of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association show that 6.14 million units of car navigation systems were shipped out in 2018, up from 4.48 million units in 2008.It may appear puzzling in that light that manufacturers are struggling.Declining prices represent one of the factors.The strength of car navigation system makers lies in their commercial products, which are marketed at auto goods shops and other outlets, with manufacturer brands pushed to the fore. It is common for upmarket models to carry price tags of several hundreds of thousands of yen, as they proudly tout large screen sizes and other features.Car enthusiasts continue to prefer upscale models of that type. As the market has expanded, however, cheaper and simpler navigator products have also come to circulate more broadly. In addition, more and more drivers are using smartphone map apps, which are becoming more popular, instead of car navigation systems.Unit prices of car navigation systems currently average about 80,000 yen, about half of the levels a decade ago, according to Autobacs Seven Co., a major chain of auto product shops.The rising presence of automakers is another factor.In the past, a consumer typically went to an auto goods shop to have a car navigation system installed in a new car after purchasing the vehicle. Commercial products were therefore the main players in the market. Car enthusiasts, who preferred products with advanced functions, accounted for a large part of the visitors to auto goods shops.In recent years, however, it is becoming increasingly common for a car navigation system to be installed in a vehicle at a dealership, in the name of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option,\u00e2\u0080\u009d before the car is delivered to its purchaser. Enthusiasts who do care about functions and appearances account for a smaller share of the buyers of similar \u00e2\u0080\u009cdealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option\u00e2\u0080\u009d products.In addition, there is also a growing share of \u00e2\u0080\u009cautomaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option\u00e2\u0080\u009d car navigation systems, which are embedded in automobiles, as early as along a production line at a manufacturing plant, as an authorized component of a car model.The market is therefore currently split into three parts by automaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option products, dealership\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option products and commercial products being marketed by the car navigation system manufacturers themselves.Car navigation system manufacturers have shifted their focus onto automaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option products to cope with the changing demand.Adoption of a car navigation system as an automaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s option product, to be installed in vehicles at their manufacturing plant, allows the maker of that system to bank on a stable volume of transactions over several years until there is a model changeover of the vehicle body. That appears particularly attractive at a time when commercial products are being sold at ever lower prices.That trend, however, has gradually eroded the management vitality of car navigation system manufacturers.The culture of \u00e2\u0080\u009ckaizen\u00e2\u0080\u009d (improvement), which is about ceaseless efforts to reduce costs and improve work efficiency, has taken root in automakers, which are the manufacturers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 transaction partners.\u00e2\u0080\u009c(Products installed by automakers) come with much smaller profit margins than commercial products,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a former official with a major car navigation system manufacturer.Performance worsened for many car navigation system makers as that trend continued.Besides the increasing pressure for cutting costs, car navigation system manufacturers also need to deal with next-generation technologies as automobiles are increasingly becoming more advanced in their functions. They have also had to strengthen their products\u00e2\u0080\u0099 car navigation functions and improve their safety features, which consumed a lot of development expenses.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe auto industry is in a time of change, which is said to exist only once in a century,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alpine President Nobuhiko Komeya told an audience of shareholders last December at the opening of an extraordinary shareholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meeting, where a plan for business integration with Alps Electric was proposed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be difficult for us to stay afloat on our own.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCompetition over technologies, including for self-driving functions and communication features, is speeding up in the auto industry. The role of car navigation systems is also expected to evolve from that of a mere \u00e2\u0080\u009cnavigator\u00e2\u0080\u009d and grow more advanced in their functions.They could double as tools for watching movies or for playing video games on. They could issue warnings about approaching obstacles or other dangers on the basis of information obtained from onboard cameras and sensors. Car navigation systems could even serve as instruments for switching a manual driving mode to a self-driving mode.There are active moves for seeking to renovate functions on and around the dashboard, including those of car navigation systems.Such development efforts require both broad-based knowledge of driving control and financial resources for making continued investments. They are being led by major auto parts manufacturers, known as megasuppliers, which work on a broad variety of component parts and have the capacity to negotiate with automakers on an equal footing.Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG, both of Germany, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Denso, and Faurecia of France, which acquired Clarion--these megasuppliers have annual sales figures in the area of several trillions of yen.By contrast, manufacturers that specialize in car navigation systems have modest annual sales ranging between 100 billion yen and 400 billion yen. They cannot compete against megasuppliers, either in stockpiling technologies or in financial strength.Many car navigation system manufacturers have chosen to partner with major auto parts makers partly to gain a foothold by which to partly withdraw from a gradually declining industry, and partly also to acquire know-how for developing next-generation technologies.President Koichi Moriya of Pioneer, which became a subsidiary to an investment fund, said he hopes to continue looking for new business partners in the years to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to take aggressive steps to proceed with various forms of business cooperation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moriya said.Flexibility and speediness for coping with changes will be requisite qualities in an age of next-generation cars.An executive with a major auto parts maker said the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emphasis is more on software development than on hardware.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody can tell what car navigation systems will be like in the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the executive said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftware matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009dInformation technology companies have also said they are entering the race for developing next-generation cars.What will car navigation systems look like in the future when automobiles have further evolved? Companies are expected to continue looking for an answer to that question.", "Chaotic scenes at Hong Kong legislature over extradition law,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,11,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong's legislative assembly descended into chaos Saturday as lawmakers for and against controversial amendments to the territory's extradition law clashed over access to the chamber.At least one person was taken from the chamber on a gurney following the morning melee, in which legislators grappled with each other on the floor and amid seats and tables.The amendments have been widely criticized as eroding the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's legal independence by making it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials.Under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong was guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.The amendments expand the scope for the transfer of criminal suspects to China and remove the legislature's right to scrutinize individual extradition decisions filed by Hong Kong's chief executive.They could also open the way for further measures to erode Hong Kong's civil liberties, including the passage of anti-subversion legislation that has been strongly opposed by many.Saturday's legislative scuffle came weeks after a Hong Kong court handed down prison sentences of up to 16 months to eight leaders of massive 2014 pro-democracy protests on public nuisance charges. The harsh sentences were seen as an effort by the Hong Kong government to draw a line under the protests amid pressure from Beijing.Tens of thousands of people marched against the extradition law amendments in Hong Kong last month and numerous legal, professional and human rights organizations have voiced their opposition. They warn the amendments would undermine not just Hong Kong's legal independence but also its attractiveness as a center for international business.Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said Friday the government would \"further explain the proposed fugitive law change to the public,\" according to the government's press office.\"Some citizens and overseas organizations might have misunderstandings about the proposed law amendments,\" Cheung said.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said the amendments must be passed to close a \"loophole\" under which the government has been unable to extradite a Hong Kong man, Chan Tong-kai, accused of killing his girlfriend in Taiwan last year. Lam was chosen in 2017 from among a slate of candidates approved by Beijing and elected by a 1,200-member pro-China electoral body.However, self-governing Taiwan has firmly ruled out signing any extradition agreement with Hong Kong unless it is treated as an equal, a condition Beijing, which claims the island as its own territory, is certain to reject. That would appear to undermine one of the government's major justifications for the amendments.Taiwanese officials have also warned that Taiwanese detained in Hong Kong could be sent to China for their political activities if the amendments are passed. A Taiwanese activist, Lee Ming-che, is currently serving a five-year sentence in China after being convicted by a Chinese court in November 2017 on charges of subverting state power for holding online political lectures and helping the families of jailed Chinese dissidents.Lee disappeared into the custody of the security services in March 2017 after crossing into China from Macau to meet with a friend. His arrest was seen as a sign the ruling party intends to extend its intolerance of criticism even outside its borders.The Hong Kong government will continue to liaise with Taiwan over the homicide case, Cheung said.", "China, U.S. to hold more trade talks as Trump ratchets up tariff threat,REUTERS,May,11,2019": "BEIJING/ WASHINGTON--China and the United States have agreed to hold more trade talks in Beijing, Vice Premier Liu He said, as U.S. President Donald Trump ordered his trade chief to begin the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China.Liu voiced a measured optimism on reaching a deal, but said there were \"issues of principle\" on which China would not back down.The United States escalated a tariff war with China on Friday by hiking levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in the midst of last-ditch talks to rescue a trade deal. Trump issued orders for the tariff increase, saying China \"broke the deal\" by reneging on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.\"Negotiations have not broken down,\" Liu, China's chief negotiator in the talks, said, according to state television.\"Quite the opposite, I think small setbacks are normal and inevitable during the negotiations of both countries. Looking forward, we are still cautiously optimistic,\" Liu said.China strongly opposes the latest U.S. tariff hike, and as a nation, has to respond to that, Liu told a small group of Chinese reporters in the video clip.\"Right now, both sides have reached mutual understanding in many things, but frankly speaking, there are also differences. We think these differences are significant issues of principle,\" Liu said. \"We absolutely cannot make concessions on such issues of principle.\"He added that talks would continue in Beijing, but gave no details.But underscoring a lack of progress in the talks, Trump ordered a further escalation of tariffs.Trump's move would subject about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports to punitive tariffs, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.Lighthizer said a final decision has not been made on the new duties, which would come on top of an early Friday tariff rate increase, to 25 percent from 10 percent, on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.Three differences remain between the two countries, according to China's account of the latest talks.One of those is over tariffs, Liu said, according to a transcript of the Q&A published by Phoenix, a Hong Kong-based television station that is close to Beijing. China believes that tariffs were the genesis of the trade dispute, and that if both sides wanted to reach an agreement, then all tariffs must be eliminated, Liu said.The second is about procurement, on which an initial consensus was reached between the leaders of the two countries in Argentina late last year. The two sides now have differing views on the volumes, Liu said. The third is over how balanced the text of the draft agreement should be, he said.\"Every nation has its dignity, so the text ought to be balanced,\" Liu said.Sources told Reuters this week that China had deleted its commitments in the draft agreement that said it would change laws to resolve core complaints of the United States: theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets; forced technology transfers; competition policy; access to financial services; and currency manipulation.Liu denied the accusations of China's reneging on promises, saying China thought it was normal to make changes before a final deal. Both sides had differing views on how to phrase it, he said.Liu said he hoped this issue would be resolved, so it was unnecessary to \"over react\" to that point.Similar to Liu, Chinese state media said China would not give in on its core interests.\"China clearly requires that the trade procurement figures should be realistic; the text must be balanced and expressed in terms that are acceptable to the Chinese people and do not undermine the sovereignty and dignity of the country,\" the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a commentary on Saturday.The trade war has weighed on the Chinese economy.When asked about domestic concerns on how the latest tariffs could further pressure the economy, Liu said he was optimistic about China's economy in the longer term, adding that it had entered an up-cycle after bottoming out somewhat last year.He said he believed the Chinese economy would maintain a stable and healthy trend despite some downward pressure, and that China had ample room for fiscal and monetary policy maneuvers.On Monday, hours after Trump said he intended to raise tariffs, the Chinese central bank cut the amount of reserves that some small and medium-sized banks need to hold, freeing up more funds for lending to cash-strapped firms.", "Chinese companies brace for tariff hike amid trade talks,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,10,2019": "BEIJING--Chinese exporters of all sorts of products, from power adapters and computers to vacuum cleaners, are anxiously hoping trade talks in Washington this week will yield a deal that might stave off higher U.S. tariffs on imports from China.Companies across China are bracing for a tariff hike on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump, complaining Beijing was backtracking and the talks on a festering trade dispute were taking too long, said he would raise import duties on $200 billion (22 trillion yen) of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent.Amber Chen, sales manager for a vacuum cleaner manufacturer based in southern China, says her company has $100 million in exports to the United States at stake.\"I really hope that the two countries can reach an agreement,\" Chen said in a phone interview. \"We just can't swallow the costs of a tariff increase.\"The trade dispute erupted last summer with the first round of U.S. tariff increases. It deepened with Trump's announcement via Twitter on Sunday that he plans to raise tariffs and have them cover all products imported from China, as of Friday.The tariffs have devastated many factories in Chinese coastal regions that serve the U.S. market. Industries such as electronics have seen sales to the United States plummet up to 40 percent. Overall Chinese exports to the United States dropped 13 percent in April from a year earlier.Many Chinese companies are reluctant to speak publicly about their problems, especially those linked to sensitive topics such as the ruling Communist Party's policies on trade and technology.But sales managers of five Chinese companies that depend heavily on exports to the United States told The Associated Press that while they have managed to adjust to current tariff levels with minimal trouble, a jump to a 25 percent tariff would make doing business with the United States virtually impossible for most of them.\"If the tariffs rise to 25 percent, then we're done for,\" said James, a sales manager for a computer monitor manufacturer in Shenzhen, China's southern tech hub.He declined to give his full name. He said 30 to 40 percent of his company's products are exported to the United States.Before this week, both the United States and China said the trade talks were making steady progress, giving the impression that the world's two biggest economies were approaching an agreement. Trump's unexpected threat Sunday sent global financial markets into a tailspin. On Thursday, China vowed to defend its interests and retaliate with \"necessary countermeasures\" if the increases take effect Friday as planned.Talks on resolving the dispute resumed later Thursday, and Trump said that he'd received \"a beautiful letter\" from Chinese President Xi Jinping and would \"probably speak to him by phone.\"Financial markets took that as a positive sign. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.4 percent. On Wall Street, Dow and S&P 500 futures also logged gains after markets closed on Thursday.China has kept official statements on the latest trade talks, the 11th round, low-key and restrained. That's in contrast to more aggressive rhetoric in earlier rounds. Domestic media avoided reporting on Trump's tweeted threat for hours after it was posted.If the tariff increase goes ahead, the impact will be deeply felt by small- and medium-sized enterprises, said Shawn Yang, sales manager for a company in Shenzhen that produces electric power adapters.\"We're on the front lines,\" he said.Many of the company's products are designed for use in the United States, Yang said, so it would be difficult to shift sales to other markets.He said he's confident it can weather the trade war because of the quality of their products, though some buyers are waiting for a conclusion to the trade dispute before placing new orders.Yang said he has faith the two countries will reach an agreement.\"(The trade war's) impact is too far-reaching,\" he said. \"It's not possible for them to keep fighting like this.\"", "Hong Kong court hands prison term to smuggler with rare turtles,By YUICHIRO MASUMITSU/ Correspondent,May,8,2019": "HONG KONG--A court here handed a one-year prison term to a Japanese man for trying to smuggle 60 endangered Ryukyu black-breasted leaf turtles into the territory on May 7.Naoki Hiraguchi, who lives in Shizuoka Prefecture and does waterproofing work, was arrested for violating the law protecting rare animals and plants.Ryukyu black-breasted leaf turtles, designated as a rare species, are only found in Okinawa Prefecture. Their trade is regulated by the Washington Convention.According to the court verdict, Hiraguchi, 43, arrived in Hong Kong on a flight from Japan last October with the turtles in his baggage.Hiraguchi's lawyer insisted his client was asked by friends in Okinawa to bring the turtles to Hong Kong.But the court viewed his conduct as \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving a commercial purpose and was malicious because so many turtles were brought in.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHong Kong is used by smugglers worldwide.The Ryukyu black-breasted leaf turtle is designated by the Japanese government as a natural monument.According to the court verdict, a single Ryukyu black-breasted leaf turtle can fetch between 120,000 yen ($1,090) and 560,000 yen on the open market.Hong Kong sources in protection of smuggled animals said that prior to 2000 turtles were mainly smuggled to China via Hong Kong from Southeast Asia for eating.But as Chinese economic growth soared, turtles have increasingly been kept for ornamental purposes.", "Images show work on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3rd, and largest, aircraft carrier,REUTERS,May,8,2019": "HONG KONG/BEIJING--Construction of China's first full-sized aircraft carrier is well under way, according to satellite images obtained and analysed by a U.S. think tank.The images from April, provided to Reuters by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, reveal considerable recent activity during the last six months on a large vessel at the Jiangnan shipyard outside Shanghai.China has not formally confirmed it is building a third carrier, despite recent hints in state media, and the timing and extent of its carrier program remain state secrets.The Pentagon said last week that work had begun, but no images have emerged until now.Both Asian and Western militaries, and regional security analysts, are seeking information on the carrier, which is expected to be China's first large, modern platform capable of leading a full range of strike group operations.The effort to build a large, locally designed carrier is seen as a core part of China's extensive military modernization drive. A series of recent Reuters Special Reports showed how that effort is challenging decades of U.S. strategic superiority in East Asia.The CSIS images show a bow section that appears to end with a flat 30-meter front and a separate hull section 41 meters wide, with gantry cranes looming overhead.That suggests a vessel, which China has dubbed Type 002, somewhat smaller than 100,000-ton U.S. carriers but larger than France's 42,500-ton Charles de Gaulle, analysts say.Fabrication halls the size of several soccer pitches have been built nearby, and work appears to be continuing on a floodable basin, possibly to float the finished hull into the nearby Yangtze River estuary.\"While details regarding the Type 002 are limited, what is observable at Jiangnan is consistent with what is expected for the People's Liberation Army Navy's third aircraft carrier,\" said the CSIS' ChinaPower analysis, published on its website Tuesday.CSIS analyst Matthew Funaiole told Reuters that images taken late last year were inconclusive, but that now the work under way is clear.\"From what we can see there has been a lot of activity in the last six months or so,\" he said. \"It would appear that it is the third carrier, and if it is not, it's hard to envisage what other large vessel it would be.\"The Pentagon's annual report on China's military modernization, issued last Friday, noted that the third carrier would probably be larger than the first two and fitted with a catapult launch system to accelerate aircraft during takeoff.\"This design will enable it to support additional fighter aircraft, fixed-wing early-warning aircraft, and more rapid flight operations,\" the report said.Funaiole and other analysts said it was unclear what kind of catapult--traditional steam-powered or a more cutting-edge electromagnetic system--would be used.It also remains unclear whether the Type 002 would be nuclear-powered. China has 10 nuclear-powered submarines, but so far no surface ships with nuclear propulsion; some analysts think China is not ready to make that step.Singapore-based regional security analyst Ian Storey said a full-sized carrier would make some of China's neighbors nervous and highlight the importance of their strategic relationship with the United States.\"Once completed, it will outclass any warship from any Asian country, including India and Japan,\" said Storey, of the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. \"It is yet another indication that China has emerged as Asia's paramount naval power.\"China's first two carriers are relatively small, with only up to 25 aircraft, less than half the number aboard U.S. carriers, and have jump ramps built into their bows. That configuration limits not just the types of aircraft that can fly off them, but how much weaponry and fuel they can carry.Its first carrier, the Liaoning, was a Soviet-era Ukrainian ship bought secondhand in 1998 and re-fitted in China. A still-unnamed second carrier based on that design, launched in 2017, was built locally.The Liaoning had been seen as more of a training platform for teaching personnel the tricky art of carrier operations. But last month, Chinese state media said the ship \"is starting to play a combat role following recent modifications and intensive training exercises.\"The second carrier has been undergoing sea trials from its base in northern Dalian and is not expected to enter service until 2020.China's state media have quoted experts as saying China needs at least six carriers. The United States operates 11 carriers.China's defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment.", "Boeing 737 Max 8 woes crimp Asian airlines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growth plans,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,7,2019": "SINGAPORE--Asian airlines are cutting routes, revamping their schedules and leasing extra aircraft to fill gaps left by the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 8s after deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.So far, regional carriers have managed to avoid major disruptions, but analysts expect that idling the Max 8s, a fuel-efficient update of Boeing's popular 737, will crimp growth plans in the near future.As investigations into the crashes continue, Boeing anticipates a $1 billion (110 billion yen) increase in costs related to the 737 Max, including fixing software implicated in the disasters, adding pilot training and compensating airlines and families of crash victims. Investigators are examining the role of flight-control software that pushed the planes' noses down based on faulty sensor readings.Nearly 400 Max jets were grounded at airlines worldwide in mid-March after the Ethiopia crash.In Asia, where air passenger traffic is growing the fastest, the groundings are pushing airlines' costs higher at a time of rising fuel prices, squeezing carriers' profits.Chinese airlines had 96 Max 8 jets but have managed to avoid massive cancellations by swapping in other models of aircraft, said Kelvin Lau of Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.\"However, this may limit their capacity growth for the coming peak season,\" he added.China Southern Airlines, which has 25 Max 8 jets, will likely revise its targeted growth for passenger capacity, he said.Indonesian carrier Lion Air, whose Flight 610 disappeared into the sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, killing 189 people, said Friday in a statement that it was \"operating normally by minimizing the impact\" from the grounding of its 10 Max 8 jets.\"Lion Air continues to serve routes that have been operated by Boeing 737 MAX 8 by replacing them using other Lion Air fleets,\" spokesman Danang Mandala Prihantoro said in a statement.India's SpiceJet has said it would lease 22 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, nine of which are already in service. The carrier said it also will deploy five Bombardier Q400 aircraft.\"The new inductions will not just bring down flight cancellations to nil but also help in SpiceJet's aggressive international and domestic expansion plans,\" chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said in a statement.Not all carriers, even those without Max 8s, have managed as well.Budget carrier Scoot, which is owned by Singapore Airlines, announced that it would suspend services between Singapore and four cities, with the first suspension starting from June. The routes were served by the Airbus A320.Scoot, which does not have any Max 8 jets, said in a statement that the cuts were \"due to a combination of weak demand and a shortage of aircraft resources.\"\"The aircraft shortage is arising as SilkAir, due to the grounding of its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet, will no longer transfer its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft to Scoot in the financial year 2019/2020,\" it said.SilkAir, the regional arm of Singapore Airlines, withdrew its six Max 8 jets from service on March 12, and its parent carrier has reassessed its capacity and fleet, opting to have Scoot grow more slowly, said Brendan Sobie of aviation consultancy CAPA.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg recently said the company was nearly finished an update to the Max that \"will make the airplane even safer.\"But given the concerns that deepened with the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 on March 10, it's unclear when the update will be deployed and how long it will take for aviation regulators and airlines to decide it's safe for the aircraft to resume operations.That's a hardship for carriers, especially during the peak summer travel season.\"Airlines don't know exactly when the Max will be back in service. This makes it a little difficult to plan, even though there is some flexibility within their fleets,\" Sobie said.", "Source: Softbank mulling IPO of $100 billion Vision Fund,REUTERS,May,4,2019": "Softbank Group Corp. is considering an initial public offering of its $100 billion Vision Fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.The fund was set up in 2017 and has become the world's largest technology investment fund. Its investments include ride-hailing pioneer Uber, chip designer ARM and shared workspace firm WeWork.The company has publicly stated it plans to set up a second investment fund. The senior banking source said Softbank was now talking to banks about helping it raise money, confirming an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.Softbank has spoken to half a dozen banks over the last month about a potential listing of the Vision Fund but has yet to start a formal process, the source said, adding he was not expecting such a process in the near term.\"They asked banks questions on how they could possibly do it. It is still very much in exploration mode,\" the source said, adding that Softbank had been possibly given the idea by fellow tech investor Naspers, which plans to list some of its assets.\"The big difference is that the biggest asset in the Naspers portfolio is Tencent, which is listed, whereas the portfolio of the Vision Fund is all private,\" the source said.China's Tencent Holdings Ltd is a social media and gaming company listed in Hong Kong.A spokesman for Softbank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.Softbank is also in talks with Oman for an investment in the fund, which has raised nearly all of its funding so far from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, according to the WSJ report.Oman was not immediately available for a comment when contacted by Reuters, nor was there an immediate response from the Japanese conglomerate.Softbank is seeking to raise new funds for \"informal deals\" chief executive officer Masayoshi Son negotiated in China for Vision Fund, one of the people told WSJ.The fund is also planning to double its staff over the next 18 months to keep up with the pace of deal making by Softbank, the company's top deputies reportedly said at a conference in Los Angeles this week.", "Support for gay rights seen growing in Singapore,THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION,May,3,2019": "KUALA LUMPUR--Singapore has seen \"distinct shifts\" in attitudes to gay rights in the last five years, with support for same-sex marriage rising, a survey released on Thursday showed.Nearly six in 10 of those aged between 18 and 25 believe same-sex marriage is not wrong, according to the survey by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore-based think-tank.Although the island remains socially conservative, the poll of 4,015 Singaporeans found opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60 percent, down from 74 percent when it was last conducted in 2013.\"Overall, Singaporeans remain fairly conservative in their outlook, though there have been distinct shifts on issues surrounding homosexual rights,\" the Institute said.\"This is especially so among respondents aged between 18 and 25, who were much more liberal about moral issues compared to the respondents aged 65 and above,\" it added.The poll, conducted between August 2018 and January 2019, focused on people's views on social, moral and political issues.The findings come amid a renewed push by gay rights activists in the city-state to overturn a British colonial-era law that bans gay sex.Two Singaporean men have filed separate petitions to court seeking to legalize gay sex since late last year, after India decriminalized gay sex in a landmark ruling.Previous legal challenges in Singapore to overturn the ban failed but a prominent diplomat last year called on the gay community to renew legal action against the law.Under Section 377A of Singapore's Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of \"gross indecency\" with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare.The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.Johannes Hadi from Ready4Repeal, a coalition that campaigns against Section 377A, said removing the law would help the Asian economic hub to retain and attract talent.\"Having Section 377A in the law book, even if it's not enforced, makes Singapore looks extremely bad,\" Hadi, a lawyer, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\"It makes us look old-fashioned, close-minded compared to places like Hong Kong or Shanghai.\"A poll of 750 Singaporeans last year by independent market research and consulting firm Ipsos showed 55 percent of respondents still supported the ban.", "Ex-CIA officer admits to espionage conspiracy with China,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,May,2,2019": "ALEXANDRIA, Va.--An ex-CIA officer pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiring with China to commit espionage after receiving a promise from his Chinese handlers that he would be financially set for life.Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 54, admitted as part of a plea bargain struck Wednesday in federal court in Alexandria that he received regular \"taskings\" from his Chinese handlers in 2010 and 2011 after the meeting in which he was promised financial assistance.But the statement of facts filed in court is silent as to whether he actually succeeded in delivering any intelligence to China.Whether he delivered secrets to the Chinese \"is a matter that will come out to some extent in sentencing,\" said U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who set sentencing for Aug. 23.Lee's lawyers, Ed MacMahon and Nina Ginsberg, said that if prosecutors had evidence Lee had delivered government secrets, they would have put it forward. MacMahon rejected assertions in some news reports that Lee was a mole responsible for exposing a network of U.S. assets in China who were eventually executed.The case against Lee \"has never included any claim that Mr. Lee was responsible for getting anyone killed,\" MacMahon said.G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case, said in a statement: \"Lee sold out his country, conspired to become a spy for a foreign government, and then repeatedly lied to investigators about his conduct.\"Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Hong Kong, could receive life in prison. But the plea deal sets federal sentencing guidelines at roughly 18 to 27 years depending on the final calculation. Ellis is free to go above or below the guidelines if he chooses.Lee served in the CIA from 1994 through 2007. During his time there, he served as an overseas case officer. According to the indictment, his primary duty as a case officer was to \"recruit clandestine human intelligence sources.\"In court Wednesday, prosecutor Neil Hammerstrom said that when Lee left the CIA in 2007, he got a job in Hong Kong with a large tobacco company but was fired in 2009 and stopped receiving income in 2010.It was that year when Lee met with Chinese intelligence officers who promised to take care of him for life financially if he cooperated. They also promised an immediate cash gift of $100,000, investigators said.After that meeting, according to the indictment, Lee's Chinese contacts delivered more than 20 envelopes between 2010 and 2011 spelling out specific tasks they wanted him to perform, most of which asked him to reveal sensitive information.The indictment states that Lee traveled to mainland China in July 2012. The next month, when Lee was on a trip from Hong Kong to the U.S., authorities carried out a search warrant in a Honolulu hotel room and found secret information in his luggage, including the real names of CIA assets.Court records show that Lee was under investigation for more than five years leading up to his arrest in January 2018.Lee's plea comes as another ex-CIA officer is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of spying for China. Kevin Mallory of Leesburg, Virginia, was convicted of providing top-secret information to Chinese handlers in exchange for $25,000.

Many of the plans agreed to between the Koreas, including joint economic projects, have been held back by a lack of progress in nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang.May Day rallies were also being held in other parts of Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Cambodia and Myanmar. Other parts of the world were set to have rallies as well.In Sri Lanka, major political parties called off traditional May Day rallies due to security concerns following the Easter bombings that killed 253 people and were claimed by militants linked to the Islamic State group.French authorities announced tight security measures for May Day demonstrations, with the interior minister saying there was a risk that \"radical activists\" could join anti-government yellow vest protesters and union workers in the streets of Paris and across the country. More than 7,400 police will be deployed, aided by drones to give them an overview of the protests and a quicker way to head off potential violence.Wearing headbands and swinging their fists, the protesters in Seoul rallied in streets near City Hall, marching under banners denouncing deteriorating working conditions and calling for equal treatment and pay for non-regular workers.The protesters also called for the government to ratify key International Labor Organization conventions that would strengthen South Korean workers' rights for organization and collective bargaining, and take firmer steps toward reforming \"chaebol,\" or huge family-owned conglomerates that dominate South Korea's economy and are often accused of corruption and monopolistic behaviors. South Korean laws ban government employees and laid-off workers from forming or joining labor unions.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which organized the protests and issued the joint statement with the North Korean organization, said more than 27,000 demonstrators turned out for Wednesday's marches in Seoul. May Day rallies were also held in other major South Korean cities, including Busan, Gwangju and Daejeon.\"A new caste system has taken hold as the discrimination of non-regular workers in wages and job status has caused extreme social divide,\" KCTU chairman Kim Myeong-hwan said at the Seoul rally. \"Small merchants, the poor, the disabled and every other member of the socially weak are living precariously in an unequal society that's dominated by chaebol and offers only a punctured social safety net.\"In Bangladesh, hundreds of garment workers and members of labor organizations rallied in Dhaka, the capital, to demand better working conditions and higher wages.Nazma Akter, president of one of Bangladesh's largest unions, said female garment workers were also demanding six months of maternity leave and protection against sexual abuse and violence in the workplace.Bangladesh has thousands of garment factories employing millions of workers, and the industry generates around $30 billion in exports a year.Construction workers, bus drivers, freelancers and domestic workers from the Philippines and Indonesia joined a Labor Day march through central Hong Kong. The protesters marched from Victoria Park to the main government offices, some carrying banners reading \"Maxed Out!\"The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which organized the march, is demanding a maximum standard work week of 44 hours and an hourly minimum wage of at least 54.7 Hong Kong dollars ($7). Construction workers called for legislation to ensure work safety, while freelance workers are seeking basic labor protections such as the right to recover unpaid wages.Thousands of low-paid workers took to the streets in Indonesia to demand higher wages, better benefits and improved working conditions in Southeast Asia's largest economy. Laborers in Jakarta, the capital, gathered at national monuments and other places, shouting their demands.\"We demand the rights of workers and their families,\" said Joko Harianto, head of the national trade union. \"People think things are good, but actually these rights are very difficult to obtain.\"In Taiwan, several thousand workers were marching through the streets of Taipei, the capital, to demand better working conditions. They carried banners and flags and chanted for more days off and higher overtime pay.Many wore baseball caps and colorful clear plastic ponchos over their clothes, though a light rain ended as the march got underway. Taiwan's official Central News Agency said 6,000 people joined the march.In the Philippines, thousands of workers and labor activists marched near the Malacanang presidential palace in Manila. They demanded that the government of President Rodrigo Duterte address labor issues including a minimum wage increase and the end of contractualization for many workers.Police said about 5,000 people joined the march, which comes just over a week before senatorial elections are held in the country. One labor group said its members would not vote for any candidate endorsed by Duterte and burned an effigy of Duterte.", "Thousands take to Hong Kong streets to protest new extradition laws,REUTERS,April,28,2019": "HONG KONG--Thousands of people marched on Hong Kong's parliament on Sunday to demand the scrapping of proposed extradition rules that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial--a move which some fear puts the city's core freedoms at risk.Opponents of the proposal fear further erosion of rights and legal protections in the free-wheeling financial hub--freedoms which were guaranteed under the city's handover from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.Early estimates suggested several thousand people had joined the march along Hong Kong Island from Causeway Bay to the council in the Admiralty business district.Veteran Hong Kong activist and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung said the government's move risked removing Hong Kongers' \"freedom from fear.\"\"Hong Kong people and visitors passing by Hong Kong will lose their right not to be extradited into mainland China,\" he said. \"They would need to face an unjust legal system on the mainland.\"The proposed changes have sparked an unusually broad chorus of concern from international business elites to lawyers and rights' groups and even some pro-establishment figures.Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong who handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997, on Saturday described the move \"as an assault on Hong Kong's values, stability and security,\" government-funded broadcaster RTHK reported.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other government officials are standing fast by their proposals, saying they are vital to plug long-standing loopholes.Under the changes, the Hong Kong leader would have the right to order the extradition of wanted offenders to China, Macau and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong's existing extradition treaties.As a safeguard such orders, to be issued case-by-case, could be challenged and appealed through the city's vaunted legal system. But they will no longer be subject to review by the council as before, according to the government's plan.Government officials have said no-one at risk of the death penalty or torture or facing a political charge could be sent from Hong Kong. Under pressure from local business groups, they earlier exempted nine commercial crimes from the new provisions.The proposals could be passed into law later in the year, with the city's pro-democratic camp no longer holding enough seats to block the move.The government has justified the swift introduction of the changes by saying they are needed so a young Hong Kong man suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan can be extradited to face charges there.Sunday's march comes amid renewed calls for deeper electoral reforms stalled five years ago after the so-called Occupy protest movement paralyzed key parts of the city for 11 weeks to demand genuine full democracy.Four leaders of the movement were last week sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight to 16 months, part of a group of nine activists found guilty after a near month-long trial.", "Michael Wolf, photographer of mega-cities, dies in Hong Kong,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,27,2019": "HONG KONG--Michael Wolf, an award-winning photographer known for his work depicting megacities, has died at his home in Hong Kong.

His body of work included Tokyo, Chicago, Paris and Hong Kong, where Wolf moved in 1994.\"His main muse was Hong Kong,\" said Greene, the director of Blue Lotus Gallery. \"Hong Kong was his favorite city, which kept inspiring him, zooming out on the beehive with his iconic work 'Architecture of Density' and zooming into the veins of the city exploring the vernacular beauty of the back alleys.\"Born in Munich, Germany, Wolf was raised in the United States and Canada and returned to Germany to study photography, according to his website. He spent most of his career in Asia.He started as a photojournalist and was a contract photographer for the German magazine Stern for eight years in Hong Kong.

Korea economy shrinks in Q1, worst since 2008 bank crisis,REUTERS,April,25,2019": "SEOUL--South Korea's economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter, marking its worst performance since the global financial crisis, as companies slashed investment and exports slumped in response to Sino-U.S. trade tensions and cooling Chinese demand.The shock contraction boosted money market bets that the central bank is likely to make a U-turn on policy soon, shifting to an easing stance and possibly cutting interest rates to counter waning business confidence and growing external risks.A worse-than-expected downturn in the memory chips sector hit first quarter capital investment, while falling exports offset gains from private consumption, the Bank of Korea said on Thursday, echoing strains in other trade-reliant Asian economies.Gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from the previous quarter, the worst contraction since a 3.3 percent drop in late 2008 and sliding from 1 percent growth in Oct.-Dec.None of the economists surveyed in a Reuters poll had expected growth to contract. The median forecast was for a rise of 0.3 percent.\"Government spending failed to keep up the bumper boost of the fourth quarter, especially for construction investment, while a drop in business investment was worse than expected due to a downturn in the chips sector,\" a BOK official said, adding there was also a strong base effect after solid fourth-quarter growth.From a year earlier, the Korean economy grew 1.8 percent in the January-March quarter, compared with 2.5 percent growth in the poll and 3.1 percent in the final quarter of 2018.South Korea's main stock index fell 0.4 percent after the data, while the won weakened to its lowest since early 2017.June futures on three-year treasury bonds rose 0.15 points to 109.58 while the nation's three-year bond yields fell below the benchmark interest rate of 1.75 percent again, in a sign that rate-cut expectations are rising to put an end to the bank's tightening cycle that began in 2017.Kong Dong-rak, a fixed income analyst at Daishin Securities, said he may push forward his rate cut call from the fourth quarter to sometime earlier this year.\"A rate cut won't come as early as May when policymakers next meet, as it will monitor how the government's supplementary bill goes at the parliament,\" Kong said.A Reuters poll of 17 economists in mid-April showed a slim majority of nine forecast a rate cut between now and 2021.The grim data came a day after the Moon Jae-in government unveiled a 6.7 trillion won ($5.9 billion or 648 billion yen) supplementary budget to tackle unprecedented air pollution levels and boost weak exports.Capital investment tumbled 10.8 percent, the worst reading since 1998, while construction investment inched down 0.1 percent, the BOK said.In an urgently called policy meeting to discuss slumping growth, finance minister Hong Nam-ki said global trade spats and uncertainties related to Brexit are delaying major investment decisions by Korea Inc.\"The economy is in a difficult situation, but the second quarter will be better than the first, and the second half will be better than the first half,\" Hong said.Exports fell 2.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, a sharper drop than the 1.5 percent decline three months earlier as Korea's export-focused economy took a hit from fifth consecutive months of shipment declines for China through March, its biggest trading partner.Shipments out of Asia's fourth-largest economy contracted for a fourth month in March.While recent data from China suggest its economy may be starting to bottom out in response to stimulus measures, analysts do not expect a sharp rebound in its import appetite like those seen in past recoveries.Economists polled by Reuters expect China's growth to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, from 6.6 percent in 2018, an April poll by Reuters showed.One saving grace for Korea in the first quarter came private consumption, which grew 0.1 percent due to a rise in demand for durable goods.A breakdown of GDP contribution showed net exports by volume boosted growth by 0.2 percentage point in the first quarter, while negative net domestic demand was a 0.5 percent point drag, resulting in a quarterly contraction of 0.3 percent in the January-march period.While South Korea's preliminary trade figures are announced in value terms, the BOK accounts for exports by volume.\"There are reasons to think that first-quarter GDP may have marked the bottom in growth, (but) the big picture is that South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic performance is likely to be lackluster in 2019 and any recovery would likely be gradual,\" ANZ said in a note, lowering its full-year forecast from 2.5 percent to 2.2 percent.", "Leaders of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests sentenced,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,24,2019": "HONG KONG--A court in Hong Kong handed down prison sentences of up to 16 months Wednesday to eight leaders of massive 2014 pro-democracy protests after they were convicted last month of public nuisance offenses.One other defendant, Tanya Chan, had her sentencing Wednesday postponed because of the need to undergo surgery.The sentences are seen as an effort by the government of the semiautonomous Chinese territory to draw a line under the protests. The charges carry potential sentences of up to seven years.Three were given 16 months, one of them suspended for two years, two were given eight-month sentences and two given suspended eight-month sentences while another was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.It was not immediately clear if they planned to appeal.\"I am still peaceful and hopeful to face whatever may happen today,\" law professor Benny Tai, who helped originate the protests, told reporters on arriving at the court.Chan said she hadn't lost faith in what the movement stood for. \"Although it's an uphill battle, it's not easy, it's time for us to make sure that we are strong enough to face different kind of challenges,\" Chan said.The nine were leaders of the \"Occupy Central\" campaign, which was organized as a nonviolent sit-in that became known as the \"Umbrella Movement\" after a symbol of defiance against police adopted by the street protests.Protesters demanded the right to freely nominate candidates for Hong Kong's leader who would then be elected by all of the territory's roughly 5 million voters.However, they failed to win any concessions from the government and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was chosen in 2017 from among a slate of candidates approved by Beijing and elected by a 1,200-member pro-China electoral body.Ranging in age from their 30s to 70s, the nine defendants span generations of Hong Kong citizens who have been agitating for full democracy. The defendants had all pleaded not guilty, calling the prosecutions politically motivated.Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement in which China promised the city could retain its own laws, economic system and civil rights for 50 years.However, Chinese President and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has been seen as extending his crackdown on civil liberties to Hong Kong, drawing criticism from commercial and legal associations as well as political, human rights and media groups.\"In the verdict, the judge commented we are naive, believing that by having a occupy movement we can attain democracy. But what is more naive than believing in one country two systems?\" protest leader Chan Kin-man said.In Taiwan, youthful supporters rallied to denounce the convictions and growing pressure from Beijing on both their self-ruled island and Hong Kong.China has demanded Taiwan agree to its claim to the island as Chinese territory, to be annexed by force if necessary, and accept a \"one country, two systems,\" framework for governing along the lines of that in place in Hong Kong.\"Occupy Central is not a crime,\" they chanted, as well as the \"The Hong Kong government is unjustified.\"", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Huawei says 1Q sales up 39% despite U.S. pressure,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,22,2019": "BEIJING--Chinese tech giant Huawei said Monday its revenue rose 39 percent over a year earlier in the latest quarter despite U.S. pressure on allies to shun its telecom technology as a security risk.Huawei, the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies, on Monday reported revenue of 179.7 billion yuan ($26.8 billion or 3 trillion yen) for the first three months of the year.Washington's pressure on allies to avoid Huawei, China's first global tech brand, threatens to block access to Europe and other markets as carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in next-generation technology.The company denies United States accusations it facilitates Chinese spying.Huawei, founded by a former Chinese military engineer in 1987, is privately held but reports financial results to try to defuse Western security concerns.Huawei gave no quarterly earnings but said its profit margin was 8 percent.

The ruling Communist Party has never declared how many people died in the crackdown and discussion of the incident is censored on social media.The video shows the photographer hiding and running from Chinese-speaking policemen before taking a picture that has come to symbolize the protests--the \"tank man\"--a protester standing in front of a convoy of tanks to block their path. The video ends with the Leica logo.The hashtag \"Leica insulting China\" surfaced on China's Twitter-like Weibo late on Thursday, before being censored. Users left hundreds of comments on Leica's official Weibo account criticizing the company for the video.\"Get out of China, you are done,\" one user posted.Others cheered the video as daring ahead of the 30th anniversary of the crackdown on June 4, but the majority of posts were scrubbed from Chinese social media by Friday and the comments section on two of its most recent Weibo posts were disabled.Users were also prevented from posting messages using Leica's English or Chinese name with warnings that they were violating laws, regulations or the Weibo community guidelines.Leica did not respond to several calls and emails from Reuters seeking comment on the video, which included other dramatizations about news photography.However, Leica spokeswoman Emily Anderson was quoted by Hong Kong's South China Morning Post as saying the video was not an officially sanctioned marketing film commissioned by the firm.\"Leica Camera AG must therefore distance itself from the content shown in the video and regrets any misunderstandings or false conclusions that may have been drawn,\" it quoted her as saying by email, adding that the firm had taken measures to not share the film on Leica's social media channels.The video was created by Brazilian ad agency F/Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi and published on its verified Twitter account on April 16 with a tweet in Portuguese that said: \"Inspired by the stories of photographers who spare no effort so that everyone can witness reality, Leica pays tribute to these brave professionals.\"Advertising websites such as Ads of the World republished the video saying it was created for Leica.Some netizens suggested the video could put pressure on Chinese telecoms equipment provider Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which uses Leica lenses in its flagship high-end phones.Huawei declined to comment while F/Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi, which has previously produced videos for Leica, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Several foreign companies have been tripped up by touching on certain topics that can provoke strong public reactions in China, including calls for boycotts.Last year, companies ranging from Delta Air Lines to Muji were criticized by the Chinese government and netizens for the language they used to describe Taiwan, a self-ruled, democratic island that Beijing considers a wayward province.", "S. Korea to shift Japan policy section, stoking fears over ties,By HAJIMU TAKEDA/ Correspondent,April,18,2019": "SEOUL--South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foreign Ministry said it will move its section on Japan policy into a planned Asian and Pacific Affairs bureau, a shakeup that local media say could scale down diplomatic efforts with Tokyo.The ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Japan section is currently set up under the Northeast Asian Affairs Bureau, which oversees diplomacy toward Japan and China.South Korean diplomats say the shift, expected to take place in May, reflects the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing trade with China, which represents about 25 percent of South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall trade value.In a statement, the ministry said it expects the move to let separate bureaus govern diplomacy toward Japan and China, two important countries in the region, to \u00e2\u0080\u009cserve as an opportunity to bolster bilateral relations.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau will be in charge of diplomacy toward Australia and India, in addition to Japan.The Northeast Asian Affairs Bureau will deal with relations with China, Mongolia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. But most of the work there is expected to focus on China.In the past, officials from the so-called Japan school with extensive training in Japanese language skills have assumed the top and senior positions of the bureau. Such postings reflected what was considered South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emphasis on diplomacy toward Tokyo.The JoongAng Ilbo, a leading local daily, said putting the Japan section in the new bureau could \u00e2\u0080\u009craise concerns that South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomacy toward Japan will be scaled back in relation to China.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Foreign Ministry also plans to set up an ASEAN bureau that will handle relations with the 10 ASEAN member nations.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q1 growth steadies, but too early to call clear recovery,REUTERS,April,17,2019": "BEIJING--China's economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown, as industrial production jumped sharply and consumer demand showed signs of improvement.The upbeat readings, which included faster investment growth, come as Beijing and Washington appear to be nearing a trade deal. Investors have ranked China's slowdown and the trade war as the biggest risks facing the faltering global economy.But analysts warn it is too early to call a sustainable turnaround in China, and further policy support is needed to maintain momentum in the world's second-largest economy. Many had expected a recovery only in the second half of 2019.Beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year to shore up growth, announcing billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending, while Chinese banks lent a record 5.8 trillion yuan ($865 billion or 97 trillion yen) in the first quarter, more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of Switzerland.\"We need more evidence to call a full-fledged recovery. Our view for the economy is still cautious,\" said Jianwei Xu, senior economist, Greater China, at Natixis in Hong Kong.\"We think it (the stronger-than-expected data) is somewhat linked to the stimulus, but we can't attribute it all to it.\"Analysts polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to slow slightly to 6.3 percent in January-March from a year earlier.Government support is gradually having an effect, though the economy still faces pressure, Mao Shengyong, spokesman at the National Bureau of Statistics, cautioned on Wednesday.Quarterly growth was supported by a sharp jump in industrial production, which surged 8.5 percent in March on-year, the fastest in over 4-1/2 years. That handily beat analysts' estimates of 5.9 percent and 5.3 percent seen in the first two months of the year.Output of construction materials such as steel and cement, as well as machinery, showed strong gains.Industrial output growth will likely remain steady, with exports expected to keep expanding, Mao said.Exports rebounded more than expected in March, but analysts say the gains could have been due to seasonal factors rather than a rebound in tepid global demand. Long holidays in February likely pushed some production into the following month.The jump in output was also somewhat at odds with trade data last week, which showed imports shrank for the fourth straight month, suggesting domestic demand is still sluggish.\"We don't think the strength in industrial output is sustainable,\" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust.\"At home, the huge amount of social financing might ease as the central bank is wary of reigniting property market bubbles, while abroad the global economic recovery is expected to slow down,\" Nie said, penciling in more moderate output growth of 6.0-6.5 percent for the rest of the year.Total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, quadrupled in March to 2.86 trillion yuan.The OECD on Tuesday sounded a warning about the dangers of prolonged stimulus, saying China's support measures will shore up growth this year and next but may undermine its drive to control debt and worsen structural distortions over the medium term.Analysts polled by Reuters expect China's economic growth to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, as sluggish demand at home and abroad and the trade war continues to weigh on activity despite support measures.The government is aiming for growth of 6.0-6.5 percent.Wednesday's data also helped ease some fears of weakening consumer confidence in China. Retail sales rose 8.7 percent in March, beating estimates of 8.4 percent and the previous 8.2 percent.Sales were led by stronger demand for home appliances, furniture and building materials, reflecting a resurgence in China's residential property market, a key economic growth driver.Real estate investment rose slightly to 11.8 percent in the first three months, while construction starts jumped in March. Data on Tuesday showed March new home prices quickened for the first time in months.But auto sales extended their decline in March, falling 4.4 percent on-year. Falls in China's auto output and sales are expected to ease and return to growth, the statistics bureau's Mao said.Fixed-asset investment expanded 6.3 percent in January-to-March from a year earlier, in line with estimates but picking up from the previous period.Local governments will be allowed to issue 2.15 trillion yuan of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects, a jump of 59 percent from last year.On a quarterly basis, GDP in the first quarter grew 1.4 percent, as expected, but dipped from 1.5 percent in October-December.Analysts do not expect a sharp rebound in China's economy like recoveries in the past, which produced a strong reflationary pulse worldwide. Most say its stimulus has been relatively more restrained this time around, given concerns about high levels of debt left over from past credit sprees.Earlier support measures will take time to fully kick in, and corporate balance sheets are expected to remain under stress if profits are slow to recover from their worst slump in more than seven years.Some analysts such as Nomura warn there is a risk of a \"double dip,\" where growth appears to be improving only to falter again a few months later. In particular, it noted a further heavy drop in land sales.The central bank has already slashed banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs.However, some analysts said authorities could be more cautious about further stimulus if data remains solid.China has rolled out many policies to support growth--the key is to implement them, Mao said.", "Asian shares little changed ahead of China GDP release,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,17,2019": "Shares were mixed in a narrow range Wednesday as China announced its economy grew at a 6.4 percent annual pace in the last quarter.Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.2 percent to 22,285.05 and the Shanghai Composite edged 0.1 percent higher to 3,256.26.

The illicit goods came from an international criminal group that has been smuggling ivory for some time, authorities said, noting that 20 suspects are now in custody.\"We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to smuggling ivory tusks, as well as other products from endangered species,\" Customs Vice Minister Hu Wei said at a news briefing.Since the start of the year, customs officers have seized a total of 7,711 kg of ivory products through 53 investigations. An additional 129 cases involved the smuggling of other endangered animal products, including pangolin scales, shark fins and turtle shells.The ivory seized on March 30 came from Nigeria and other African countries, said Sun Zhijie, head of the administration's anti-smuggling bureau. It was shipped across multiple countries, hidden in cargo containers of wood and kept in an old Chinese waste factory while the suspects prepared to sell it, Sun said.China has cracked down on smuggling in recent years and implemented in 2018 a total ban on all trade in ivory products. The ban does not cover the semiautonomous port of Hong Kong, which remains a major transit point for endangered species products and other contraband. The financial center is now working toward a complete ban on the local ivory trade, slated to take effect by 2021.", "U.S. to press allies to keep Huawei out of 5G in Prague meeting--sources,REUTERS,April,16,2019": "WASHINGTON/LONDON--The United States will push its allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for China's Huawei to dominate 5G telecommunications networks, according to people familiar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters.The event and broader U.S. campaign to limit the role of Chinese telecommunications firms in the build out of 5G networks comes as Western governments grapple with the national security implications of moving to 5G, which promises to be at least 100 times faster than the current 4G networks.The issue is crucial because of 5G's leading role in internet-connected products ranging from self-driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence. If the underlying technology for 5G connectivity is vulnerable then it could allow hackers to exploit such products to spy or disrupt them.The United States has been meeting with allies in recent months to warn them Washington believes Huawei's equipment could be used by the Chinese state to spy. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has repeatedly denied the allegations.Officials from more than 30 countries will meet May 2-3 to agree on security principles for next-generation telecoms networks, said Robert Kahofer, chief of cabinet at Czech cybersecurity agency NUKIB.A U.S. official familiar with the plan said the Prague meeting marks a strategic shift in how the U.S. government plans to urge allies to drop Huawei and other 5G vendors in the future, which Washington believes pose a risk to national security. The official described the approach as \"softer.\"A Huawei spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.U.S. proposals for the Prague meeting urge governments and operators to consider the legal environment in a vendor's country, how much state support a company receives, transparency of corporate structure, and trustworthiness of equipment. It also calls on partners to prioritize security and work together on investigations into cyberattacks aimed at 5G architecture.The documents do not mention Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, by name, but U.S. officials said they hoped it would provide the \"intellectual framework\" needed for other countries to effectively bar Chinese vendors. In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using Huawei and ZTE Corp equipment.\"The goal is to agree upon a set of shared principles that would ensure the security of next-generation telecommunications networks,\" said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.The Prague conference has been organized by the Czech foreign ministry with support from NUKIB, said Kahofer. The foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.Delegations from all of the European Union's 28 member states, as well as the European Commission, NATO and around eight other countries including the United States and Australia are expected to attend, Kahofer said.China and Russia have not been invited, he added, but stressed that the event was not \"an anti-Huawei or anti-China conference.\"Europe has emerged as a key battleground for the future of 5G, with the United States pushing allies and partners to bar Chinese vendors but European governments wary of the trade and economic consequences of angering Beijing.Internet service providers have also warned that banning Huawei would incur huge costs and delay the rollout of 5G by years.A senior U.S. cybersecurity official said last week Washington wanted European governments to adopt \"risk-based security frameworks\", citing recent moves in Germany to implement stricter security standards for all 5G vendors, and that doing so would effectively rule out using Huawei and ZTE.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe United States welcomes engagement from partners and allies to discuss ways that we can work together ensuring that our 5G networks are reliable and secure,\" said White House National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis.Officials in Britain, which last month exposed new security flaws in Huawei equipment but says it has found no evidence of Chinese state interference, have also spoken of \"raising security across the board\" for 5G.The European Commission said in March that EU nations would be required to share data on 5G cybersecurity risks and produce measures to tackle them by the end of the year.", "In Cantonese opera, Trump finds his twin brother in China,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,14,2019": "HONG KONG--With the blond wig and red tie, the star of the Cantonese opera in Hong Kong may look familiar.The Chinese actor and singer has the lead role in \"Trump on Show,\" a four-day comedic opera reimagining the U.S president's personal life and his fictional twin brother who lives in China.The three-hour opera opens with America's first family moving into the White House, where Trump's daughter Ivanka discovers an old suitcase. Inside she finds an English version of \"The Little Red Book,\" which details ideas on class struggle by the founding chairman of modern communist China.In the show, Donald Trump goes to China and meets Mao and Zhou En-lai, the first premier of communist China. Trump also receives a visit from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the U.S.Li Kui-Ming, a 64-year-old feng shui master turned Cantonese opera playwright, explains that his 34th opera piece does not aim to focus on serious international politics. Rather, the show simply uses current political characters to grab the audience's attention.\"It could definitely draw people's attention if the play is about popular political figures due to their popularity and influence. I hope this opera will get my ideas across to the audience,\" he said.He hopes that one day, \"Trump on Show\" could even be performed at the White House or in Pyongyang for Kim Jong Un.\"This is definitely our dream,\" he said.The opera plays until Monday at the Sunbeam Theatre, which is one of the long-established traditional Cantonese opera venues in Hong Kong, created in 1972.\"This opera has to be performed in Cantonese, but of course, there will be some English in it,\" said Loong Koon-tin, a Cantonese actor with more than 40 years' stage experience, who plays Trump. \"I will certainly portray Trump's special characteristics. I will wear a red tie and suit, with a blond hair wig and golden eyebrows,\" he said. \"Apart from the appearance, I would also imitate the way he talks as well as his body language.\"Roger Chan, a Cantonese actor who plays Kim, said they did a lot of research on the North Korean leader. \"We try to get to know him through daily news reports,\" he said.\"I think the theme is very fresh, original and unimaginable because it must be difficult to use traditional Cantonese opera elements and performing methods to perform and interpret the role of these modern world-leading characters,\" said Chan Chi-kai, who came to see the show as a loyal fan of the playwright.Another audience member, Justin Lee, came all the way from Shanghai.\"With the recent tense relationship between China and America due to the trade war, I want to watch this show and see how the playwright depicts Donald Trump, and hope the show will bring on new ideas to improve U.S.-China relationship,\" he said.", "After 6 months, Toyosu market struggles with shrinking trade,THE ASAHI SHIMBUN,April,12,2019": "Grievances over parking. Complaints about declining business. Anxieties over the prospect of losing clients.These were not the words Tokyo metropolitan government officials expected to hear on April 11, the half-year anniversary of the Toyosu wholesale market.Few were hoisting glasses in celebration at the 570-billion-yen ($5.1 billion) market in Tokyo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Koto Ward, which replaced the aging but tourist-popular Tsukiji wholesale market in Chuo Ward.The modern Toyosu market, located on a 40.7-hectare plot, was designed to be a new \u00e2\u0080\u009ckitchen of Japan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in its six months of operation, there have been too few cooks in the kitchen.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have lost about 20 percent of sales since we moved from Tsukiji to Toyosu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Takehisa Inoue, 81, chairman of intermediate wholesaler Teryou, lamented.Various reasons for the downturn have been floated, ranging from changing diets in Japan to a lack of affordable parking spots.Some wholesalers in the market have already shifted away from domestic sales and are now focused on exporting marine products.When asked for the reason behind Toyosu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles, a Tokyo metropolitan government official said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is difficult to identify at this moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTeryou, which delivers dozens of kilograms of popular fish, such as mackerel and squid, to supermarkets and chain stores every day, pointed out one of the symptoms.Inoue said the company has not lost these large-volume customers, but \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrade with smaller-scale customers who pay in cash, like \u00e2\u0080\u0098koryoriya\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (folksy Japanese restaurants), has plummeted.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOther sellers at the market have also reported a sharp decrease in cash transactions with staff, chefs and other employees of smaller businesses.Such customers used to flock to the Tsukiji market, which was within walking distance of Ginza, a high-end district with many small restaurants.In August 2018, the Tokyo metropolitan government mapped out a plan to increase trade volume of marine products at the Toyosu market to 620,000 tons a year, 1.6 times the current figure, over the first five years of its opening.Unlike Tsukiji, the Toyosu market is equipped with enclosed facilities where low temperatures can be maintained to improve hygiene and preserve the quality of fresh seafood. The new market also has processing facilities.The metropolitan government expected the modern features would satisfy the demands of supermarkets and other buyers.In October, the first month of operations, the trade volume at the Toyosu market was the largest among all markets in the nation, but it was down 2.4 percent from the same month the previous year.Even in December, the busiest month for seafood purchases, trade volume at the market plummeted by 10.1 percent from the same month in 2017.The year-on-year slide in trade volume has continued, falling 4.4 percent in January and 7.2 percent in February.According to the Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data, the decline in trade volume of marine products started decades ago, long before the Toyosu market opened.Fish consumption among Japanese has dropped in recent years, while imports have increased and direct \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarm fresh\u00e2\u0080\u009d sales from producers have grown popular.Other markets, such as the ones in Tokyo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ota Ward and Yokohama, have also reported year-on-year losses in trade. The markets in the capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Adachi Ward and Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture have maintained roughly the same trade volume.A 59-year-old owner of a sushi restaurant in Tokyo explained one issue that has really annoyed merchants and customers at the Toyosu market: parking.He said he looked for a fixed-rate contract for a parking space inside the Toyosu market, but he gave up after being told the fee would be at least four times the price he paid at the Tsukiji market.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven a supermarket offers free parking for customers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grumbled.Hourly-rate parking is also available in a five-story building where intermediate marine product wholesalers are located. But only about 50 spaces are offered, and they each cost 300 yen for 30 minutes.The metropolitan government came up with a temporary solution. It opened up parking space for about 250 vehicles at the proposed site of the Senkyaku Banrai shopping and entertainment complex, which is expected to be built adjacent to the market.But the relief effort had ended by April because the space is now being used for events to pull in more customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur clients may decide to go to other markets if parking is expensive and inconvenient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an intermediate wholesaler at the Toyosu market said.Under these circumstances, the metropolitan government and the industry are shifting their energy toward exports to other Asian countries and the United States.The improved hygiene at the Toyosu market makes it easier to meet overseas health standards.Kamewa Shoten, an intermediate wholesaler, invested about 80 million yen to build a processing plant inside the Toyosu market.Workers at the plant fillet just-purchased Japanese flounder and great amberjack, and the flesh is quickly vacuum-packed for air transport to Hong Kong and Singapore.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can complete the entire process, from purchasing to processing to shipping, inside the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kazuhiko Wada, the 56-year-old president of Kamewa Shoten.The number of export-oriented intermediate wholesalers at the Toyosu market has grown by 10 percent to 20 percent to more than 100 since the market opened, thanks largely to the increase in Japanese restaurants abroad, according to Nippon Express and the Wholesales Co-operative of Tokyo Fish Market.Hiroji Fujishima, a visiting professor at Tokyo Seiei College and an expert on food product distribution, said about the Toyosu market, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there are more things that they can do, not only processing and exporting, but also coordinating with other markets and Internet retailing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(This article was written by Naomi Nishimura and Noriyasu Nukui.)", "China police seize drug shipment concealed in banana truck,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,11,2019": "BEIJING--Chinese police have seized a haul of methamphetamine and heroin concealed in a truckload of bananas believed to have come from Myanmar.State media reported Thursday that the drug shipment weighing 144.5 kilograms was seized in the city of Tongren in the southern province of Guizhou after a tipoff.The shipment was believed to have originated in Myanmar and crossed the border into China's Yunnan province on Saturday.One suspect was arrested in the seizure which took place Saturday. Yunnan borders the infamous \"Golden Triangle\" drug producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos meet.The U.N.'s anti-drug agency said last month that production of methamphetamine is skyrocketing in Southeast Asia, with prices dropping and usage expanding. China prosecutes drug crimes harshly but remains a major market due partly to rising incomes in the country of 1.4 billion people.Earlier this month, customs agents in the semiautonomous Chinese territory of Hong Kong seized a massive haul of cocaine with an estimated street value of $13 million (1.4 billion yen) and arrested one suspect.As a major Asian port city, Hong Kong is considered a key transit point for contraband from illegal drugs to endangered wildlife parts. Much of that is bound for mainland China or Southeast Asia where drug laws tend to be much stricter.Meanwhile, U.S. officials have repeatedly pointed to China as the main source of synthetic opioids shipped into the country directly by mail or transported via Mexico. China denies that claim, but said this month it would begin regulating all fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances.", "Record hauls of endangered pangolin scales sparks concern,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,11,2019": "SINGAPORE--Singapore seized more than 28 tons of pangolin scales belonging to around 38,000 of the endangered mammals in the past week, a global record that spurred calls for more protection for pangolins, whose scales are used in traditional medicine.The scales were linked to four species of pangolins native to Africa.A record 14.2 tons of the scales were found hidden among packets of frozen beef in shipping containers on April 3. Five days later, they found 14 more tons in 474 bags in another container. The National Parks Board, Singapore Customs and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said in a statement Wednesday that the cargo was declared as cassia seeds. Both shipments were en route from Nigeria to Vietnam.\"The sheer size of these two latest seizures is unprecedented and will undoubtedly prove a major setback to the traffickers concerned,\" said Richard Thomas of monitoring network Traffic.He warned that the seizures themselves won't put the traffickers out of business. \"The quantities of pangolins involved point to sourcing, processing and distribution on an industrial scale,\" Thomas said.The pangolin is said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world, and its scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine. The scales are made of keratin, the same material in human fingernails. Their meat is also considered a delicacy in China and other Asian countries.Wildlife groups are concerned that the busts point to a jump in poaching of pangolins.\"The World Health Organization recently endorsed traditional medicine and the industry appears keen to grow this market, outside of China, Vietnam and beyond,\" said Neil D'Cruze, the global wildlife adviser at the World Animal Protection. \"This is an alarming move for some wildlife species such as pangolins, as it poses a real conservation and animal welfare threat.\"Pangolins are an extremely lucrative catch, he said. In rural communities where they're hunted, poachers can make up to the equivalent of a full year's salary from catching just one pangolin. Feeding \"the insatiable demand\" are middlemen traffickers who also profit from the trade that's reaching more remote communities to hunt the animal, he added.Paul Thomson, an official at the Pangolin Specialist Group, said it looks like the pangolin poaching has increased but figures were difficult to ascertain.\"The illegal trade in pangolin parts has been going on for decades. However, pangolins have typically been overlooked in terms of concerted conservation attention and action,\" Thomson told The Associated Press. \"This is changing thanks to growing awareness of pangolins. And this awareness has partly been driven by the high volumes of trafficking seen today.\"In February, Malaysian officials seized 30 tons of pangolin and pangolin products. This included live and frozen pangolins and 361 kilograms of their scales.Earlier that month, Hong Kong said it had seized ivory tusks and 8.3 tons of pangolin scales belonging to as many as 13,000 pangolins. The shipment, which originated in Nigeria, was bound for Vietnam.Singapore made two markedly smaller pangolin scale busts in 2015 and 2016 amounting to 440 kg. Those found to have illegally imported, exported or re-exported wildlife, including their parts, face a maximum punishment of two years in prison and a fine of 500,000 Singapore dollars ($367,000 or 41 million yen).\"There has never been a more opportune moment for full and thorough international investigations and collaborations to take place to find out who has perpetrated these criminal acts and bring those behind them to face justice,\" Thomas said.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spreading influence in Eastern Europe worries West,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,11,2019": "BELGRADE--Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe's cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing's mounting economic and political influence on the continent.EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries--the eighth so far--that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China's ambitious global \"Belt and Road\" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members--or those hoping to join--could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of construction and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government's financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.Of the 16 participating countries--Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia--11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe's neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring \"neo-colonial\" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.European leaders \"have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests,\" Tija said.Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary's relations with China should be based on \"mutual respect.\"Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China's human rights record and business policies.In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where \"China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets,\" without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million or 75 billion yen) loan from China's Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia's largest coal-fired power plant.EU's energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia's bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU's subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue \"raises serious questions\" about the Balkan country's \"commitment to international treaties (and) European rules.\"Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman's positive stance toward Huawei.Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic's business interests as it could affect Huawei's plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.", "Hong Kong protest organizers free on bail before sentencing,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,10,2019": "HONG KONG--A Hong Kong court extended bail Wednesday for nine pro-democracy protest organizers who are awaiting sentencing after being convicted of public nuisance offenses.The guilty verdicts handed down Tuesday against the nine were condemned by rights activists as a likely sign of increasing restrictions on free expression in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.The defendants will be sentenced April 24.The nine were leaders of 2014's nonviolent \"Occupy Central\" campaign, also known as the \"Umbrella Movement\" after a key symbol of defiance against police adopted by the street protests that shut down parts of the financial hub for 79 days.Protesters demanded the right to choose Hong Kong's own leader rather than merely approve a candidate picked by Beijing but failed to win any concessions from the government.Ranging in age from their 30s to 70s, the nine defendants span generations of Hong Kong citizens who have been agitating for full democracy. The defendants had all pleaded not guilty, calling the prosecutions politically motivated.The charges carry a maximum penalty of seven years.The former British colony was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement in which China promised it could retain its own laws, economic system and civil rights for 50 years.However, Chinese president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has been seen as extending his crackdown on civil liberties to Hong Kong, drawing criticism from commercial and legal associations as well as political, human rights and media groups.", "China state planner wants to eliminate bitcoin mining,REUTERS,April,9,2019": "SHANGHAI--China's state planner wants to ban bitcoin mining, according to a draft list of industrial activities the agency is seeking to stop in a sign of growing government pressure on the cryptocurrency sector.China is the world's largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even though such activities previously fell under a regulatory gray area.The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to over 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has until May 7 to comment on the draft.State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday that the draft list \"distinctly reflects the attitude of the country's industrial policy\" towards the cryptocurrency industry.Last week, the price of bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of the 2017 bubble, and breaking $5,000 (556,755 yen) for the first time since mid-November, though analysts and traders admitted that they were puzzled by the surge.On Tuesday, bitcoin was trading at $5,190.The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms--among them some of the world's largest--to find bases elsewhere.Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, and last year three filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, looking to raise billions of dollars.However, the two largest, Bitmain Technologies, the world's largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining gear, and Canaan Inc., have since let their applications lapse.People familiar with the deals said that Hong Kong regulators had many questions about the companies' business models and prospects.According to Canaan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IPO prospectus filed last year, sales of blockchain hardware primarily for cryptocurrency mining in China were worth 8.7 billion yuan ($1.30 billion or 144 billion yen) in 2017, 45 percent of global sales by value.The prospectus forecasts that sales in China would rise to 35.6 billion yuan by 2020.", "Hong Kong activists found guilty for role in mass rallies,REUTERS,April,9,2019": "HONG KONG--A Hong Kong court found leaders of the 2014 \"Occupy\" civil disobedience movement guilty on Tuesday of public nuisance charges during the mass protests, in a landmark verdict that comes as the China-ruled city's freedoms come under strain.Scores of supporters clapped in support of the nine defendants including a law professor, two lawmakers and former student activists, after the judge delivered his verdict following a trial that critics say highlights shrinking political freedoms in the former British colony.Three of the defendants accused of playing a leading role in planning and mobilizing supporters during the 79-day street occupations in 2014--Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and retired pastor Chu Yiu-ming--were found guilty of conspiracy to commit public nuisance.Tai and Chan were also found guilty of incitement to commit public nuisance. They appeared calm after the verdict was delivered, and Chan bowed to supporters clapping for them outside the court. The trio had pleaded not guilty to all charges, which each carry a maximum seven years jail.Tai, speaking to Reuters before the verdict, said: \"We will still continue our struggle for democracy,\"The reason that we committed civil disobedience is because we want justice for Hong Kong people.\"In a summary of his judgment, Justice Johnny Chan noted that while the concept of civil disobedience is \"recognized in Hong Kong,\" it wasn't a defense to a criminal charge.\"The offense of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance does not have the undesirable effect of curtailing or suppressing civil disobedience at its formation stage or suppressing human rights as the defendants contended,\" the summary read.The six other defendants include pro-democracy legislators Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, two former student leaders Eason Chung and Tommy Cheung, activist Raphael Wong, and veteran democrat Lee Wing-tat, were also found guilty of at least one public nuisance charge.No sentences were immediately given by the judge.The nine defendants were accused of inciting and mobilizing protesters during the pro-democracy demonstrations that blocked major roads in several parts of the global financial hub for 79 days in late 2014, in one of the boldest populist challenges against Beijing in decades.The demonstrators were finally cleared away by police, having won no democratic concessions from the government.Since the city returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, critics say China has reneged on its commitment to maintain Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms under a co-called \"one country, two systems\" arrangement.In the more than four years since the Occupy protests, democracy activists, diplomats and business leaders have expressed grave concerns over what they say is Beijing's tightening grip on the city's freedoms.", "Hong Kong customs seizes massive cocaine haul,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,4,2019": "HONG KONG--A haul of cocaine with an estimated market value of $13 million (1.4 billion yen) has been seized in Hong Kong, customs agents said Thursday.The customs service in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory said one man was arrested in the operation Wednesday that netted 91 kilograms of the drug.

It's a country of just 4 million people but its canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans makes it one of the world's busiest trade arteries and strategically important both to Washington and Beijing.As American officials express alarm at Beijing's ambitions in the U.S.-dominated Western Hemisphere, China has launched a charm offensive, wooing Panamanian politicians, professionals and journalists.The Chinese ambassador, a Spanish-speaking Latin American veteran, has been talking up the benefits of Belt and Road on TV and Twitter. Beijing has flown professionals and journalists on junkets to China. It seems to be paying off.\"We see a big opportunity to connect Asia and America to Panama,\" Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela said during a visit to Hong Kong this week. He is due to attend a Belt and Road forum in Beijing with other foreign leaders this month, according to the Chinese government.Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature foreign initiative, Belt and Road is building railways, ports, power plants and other projects in dozens of countries around the globe. But the United States, Japan, Russia, India and other governments fret that Beijing is gaining economic and strategic influence at their expense.\"A strong U.S. reaction, whether it is obvious in public or not, is coming,\" said Matt Ferchen, an expert on China-Latin America relations at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.Panama's leaders see China as a source of trade and investment but want to avoid conflict with Washington. Varela has said Panama's relationship with China \"will not affect relations with our strategic partner.\"Belt and Road is building on multibillion dollar deals for loans and investments in oil and mining in South America that Beijing made beginning in the 1990s.Venezuela has received $62 billion (7 trillion yen) in Chinese loans. Brazil owes $42 billion and Argentina $18 billion. Ecuador has borrowed $17 billion.Mexican President Manuel Andres Lopez Obrador has said he is considering joining Belt and Road. That would give it a foothold in a country bordering the United States.In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago agreed last May to take part. In September, a state-owned Chinese company was awarded a contract to build a dry dock.American officials say governments should be wary.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited in October and met with Varela, whose term runs through July. Afterward, Pompeo told reporters Panama \"should keep its eyes wide open\" concerning Chinese investments.\"We are all concerned about China and by the way that China is entering those countries,\" Pompeo said at the Group of 20 meeting of major economies in Argentina in December. Such projects are not always driven by \"good intentions,\" he said.In a coup for Beijing, Panama switched diplomatic recognition in June 2017 to China from Taiwan, the self-ruled island the communist mainland claims as its own territory. That cut Taiwan's biggest political tie to Latin America.U.S. President Donald Trump's \"America first\" policies are not helping the U.S. cause in the region, said businessman Roberto Eisenmann, founder of Panama's most influential newspaper, La Prensa.Trump has yet to name a replacement for U.S. Ambassador John Feeley, who announced his retirement in January 2018.\"They are leaving a vacuum of leadership that obviously the Chinese are trying to fill,\" said Eisenmann.Two months after Pompeo stopped by, Varela welcomed Xi on an official visit and proclaimed his support for Belt and Road. Varela told Xi that Panama wants to \"play a front-line role\" in helping to build a more interconnected world.The next day, Varela joined a ceremony where a consortium including two Chinese companies was awarded a contract to build a fourth bridge across the Panama Canal, whose ports of entry at its Atlantic and Pacific ends are operated by a Hong Kong consortium.China, the canal's second-largest user after the United States, has \"considerable strategic interest\" in Panama, said Margaret Myers, director of Asia and Latin America for the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank in Washington.\"There are concerns about the possible effects on U.S. firms, on regional stability and, above all, on U.S. influence in the region,\" she said.Launched in 2012, Belt and Road now encompasses most Chinese commercial initiatives abroad.Most projects involve Chinese loans at commercial interest rates, adding to concerns Beijing is building a China-centered trade and political structure that might leave poor countries with too much debt.Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia and some other countries have canceled or renegotiated projects due to costs or complaints they would do too little for local economies.China has dismissed such concerns.Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said Beijing is trying to reshape how the initiative is perceived. But there's no indication it is addressing problems that led to complaints that Sri Lanka, Kenya and other countries ended up with too much debt.\"I don't think they have learned the important lessons,\" said Tsang. \"What they have learned are the superficial ones.\"China's ambassador, Wei Qiang, has been laying groundwork for deeper involvement in Panama.In March 2018, he met with members of the opposition Revolutionary Democratic Party, whose candidate for this May's presidential election, Laurentino Cortizo, is leading in polls.Cortizo said he plans to meet with Wei to \"look at the future of this relationship.\"Wei has invited Eisenmann, the newspaper founder, to his official residence to discuss Panama's \"plans for the 'Silk Road.'\"China has proposed building a high-speed rail line from Panama City to the town of David near its western border with Costa Rica.So far, projects awarded to Chinese contractors--the canal bridge, a cruise ship dock and a convention center--have been paid for by the Panamanian government. The country has yet to receive Chinese loans.", "Renault board meets over Ghosn investigation, paycheck,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,April,3,2019": "PARIS--The board of carmaker Renault is meeting to settle ex-chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn's final paycheck--and wrap up its investigation into possible financial wrongdoing under his leadership.The meeting Wednesday at Renault's headquarters in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt comes after new reports of suspicious payments to a Renault-Nissan distributor in Oman under Ghosn's watch.Ghosn has denied wrongdoing, and announced Wednesday that he will hold a news conference next week \"to tell the truth about what's happening.\" He's facing financial misconduct charges in Japan, where he also served as chairman of Nissan before his November arrest.The Renault meeting will finalize pay packages for Ghosn and other executives for 2018. Ghosn's fixed salary at Renault was 1.2 million euros ($1.3 million or 145 million yen) but he also received variable pay based on company and personal performance.", "Proposed Hong Kong extradition law changes spark concerns,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,31,2019": "HONG KONG--Business and human rights groups are expressing concern over proposed changes to Hong Kong's extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China where they could be subject to torture and unfair prosecution.They say the move would harm the Asian financial hub's attractiveness to international business.Hong Kong currently limits such extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing extradition agreements or to others on an individual basis under a law passed before the semi-autonomous territory's handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. China was excluded because of concerns over its poor record on legal independence and human rights.However, changes to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance would expand the scope for the transfer of criminal suspects to China and remove the legislature's right to scrutinize individual extradition decisions filed by Hong Kong's chief executive.\"These amendments would heighten the risk for human rights activists and others critical of China being extradited to the mainland for trial on fabricated charges,\" Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said in an news release Sunday.\"The amendments would tarnish Hong Kong's reputation for the rule of law, and should be scrapped,\" Richardson said, adding the legal changes would put Hong Kong people \"at risk of torture and unfair trials.\"Those concerns were reflected in a letter to Chief Executive Carrie Lam authored by Human Rights along with the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor and the local branch of Amnesty International.The groups warned that fear of extradition to China--which routinely uses trumped-up charges of tax evasion or other economic crimes to punish political critics--could stifle civil society and freedom of speech in Hong Kong, where civil liberties are already under assault from pro-Beijing groups. In recent years, several people connected with a Hong Kong publishing house that produced unflattering books on mainland Chinese leaders have appeared in Chinese police custody after apparently being abducted, along with a prominent business person wanted on the mainland.Unlike China, Hong Kong is subject to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as \"customary international law,\" which \"prohibit returning people to places where there is a real risk of torture and other ill-treatment, unfair trials, and other serious human rights violations,\" the letter said.Separately, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong issued a letter saying its member \"continue to have serious concerns\" about the proposed changes, saying they would \"reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations.\"\"Hong Kong's international reputation for the rule of law is its priceless treasure,\" said the letter.", "Thai king strips fugitive ex-PM Thaksin of royal decorations,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,31,2019": "BANGKOK--Thailand's king has stripped fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of his royal decorations, citing his 2008 flight to escape serving a two-year prison term on a conflict of interest conviction and other legal cases against him.Thai media reported that the Royal Command from King Maha Vajiralongkorn was published Saturday in the Royal Gazette.The move follows a March 24 general election in which a party loyal to Thaksin claimed it won enough seats to form a coalition that would hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Final certified results will not be issued until May 9, and the state Election Commission has warned there could be some disqualifications by then.Last week, a military award Thaksin has been given was revoked by the army, with the explanation that he failed to deserve the honor.King Vajiralongkorn on election eve had issued a statement urging voters to select \"good people\" for public office, a message taken as implicitly advising support of Thaksin's opponents, since the term \"good people\" has become a popular description for those opposed to the former prime minister.Thaksin, a billionaire with populist policies, became prime minister in 2001 but was ousted by a 2006 military coup. Abuse of power and disrespect for the monarchy were two of the accusations that were offered as justification for the coup.The army staged another coup in 2014 against a government that had been formed by Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was forced out of office on a controversial charge, later found guilty of negligence in her duties, and also fled into exile.The 2014 coup was led by then-army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has been junta chief and prime minister since then, and is the candidate of the military-backed Palang Pracharath Party, which won the highest number of popular votes in the March 24 polls.The 2006 coup set off a sometimes violent struggle for power between Thaksin's supporters and opponents, and pro-Thaksin parties staged several comebacks even though the military and other royalists have tried to dismantle his political machine.These include changes in the Constitution and election laws under the military government that has been in power for the past five years that were meant to handicap parties loyal to Thaksin.The hostility of royalists towards Thaksin has been evident since he was in office, though was never expressed directly by members of the royal family, including Vajiralongkorn's father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. The royal family by tradition is above politics.King Vajiralongkorn's older sister, Princess Ubolratana, caused an uproar in February when the pro-Thaksin Thai Raksa Chart Party registered her as its nominee for prime minister. The move was initially seen as a clever ploy by Thaksin's political machine to immunize itself against charges that it opposed the monarchy. It backfired badly when the king declared it inappropriate and unconstitutional, and the party was dissolved by the courts before the election, hurting the pro-Thaksin forces.Princess Ubolratana, however, made a high-profile appearance at the wedding reception of one of Thaksin's daughters in Hong Kong just two days before the election. Photos and video of the event showed Thaksin welcoming her warmly.Thailand's monarchy is protected by strong lese majeste laws that make whatever is judged defamatory of the royal family punishable by three to 15 years' imprisonment.", "JP Morgan, Nomura get nod for China brokerage JVs as market access expands,REUTERS,March,30,2019": "SHANGHAI/HONG KONG--JP Morgan and Nomura have won Chinese regulatory approval to set up majority-owned brokerage joint ventures, in China's latest move to open its financial sector up to foreign firms.The China Securities Regulatory Commission said on Friday it will continue to approve foreign brokerage joint ventures \"efficiently,\" after announcing its decision for the two banks.Allowing foreign banks a controlling stake in securities joint ventures is a key part of China's pledge to ease ownership curbs, especially in the trillion-dollar financial sector.A lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for western investment banks, and a reason behind JP Morgan's 2016 decision to sell its 33 percent ownership in its then Chinese joint venture.Western banks including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse run joint ventures, whose offerings include debt and equity underwriting and financial advisory, with varying degrees of operational control.Beijing gave UBS approval in November to hold a majority stake in its securities joint venture, making it the first foreign bank to do so under new rules announced in 2017.JP Morgan and Nomura applied to set up majority-controlled joint ventures in China last year. But unlike UBS, neither has a mainland joint venture and would need to start from scratch.The majority-owned securities venture will allow JP Morgan to further strengthen its China business and offer \"a complete set of services and solutions\" to its clients, the Wall Street bank said in a statement.\"It's a critical component of our growth plans globally as well as in Asia Pacific,\" JP Morgan Asia Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Nicolas Aguzin, said.Nomura said it's China joint venture would initially focus on the wealth management business, and expand its offerings \"with the ultimate goal of growing the business into a full-fledged brokerage\".\"With an increased presence in China, we aim to support economic growth in both China and Japan and firmly establish ourselves as a global financial services group with deep roots in Asia,\" Nomura Chief Executive Koji Nagai said.The recent approvals for greater access to foreigners, from insurance to asset management, comes amid a festering trade war with the United States, with increased access to the financial sector among a host of demands from Washington.Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that Beijing will expand market access for foreign banks and securities and insurance companies, especially in financial services.China has in recent years allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in joint ventures.Besides UBS, HSBC also holds 51 percent of its securities business in China, which was launched in 2017, but the Asia-focused bank does so under rules allowing Hong Kong-based companies special access.", "Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tsai confirms request to buy new U.S. fighters, tanks,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,28,2019": "BEIJING--Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said her government has asked to purchase advanced new fighter jets and tanks from the United States.If approved, the move could set off new tensions between the United States and China, which considers Taiwan its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary. Speaking during a visit to Hawaii on Wednesday, Tsai said requests have been submitted for F-16V fighters and M1 Abrams tanks.The new weaponry would \"greatly enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen military morale, and show to the world the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense,\" Tsai said.The United States is Taiwan's main supplier of defensive weapons, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties. The F-16V is the most advanced version of the plane that already forms the backbone of Taiwan's air forces, while the M1 Abrams would mark a significant upgrade from the aging, refurbished models the army now uses. Reports say Taiwan is seeking 66 of the planes.Taiwan's arms requests are carefully reviewed to ensure they suit \"Taiwan's actual needs,\" Tsai said.\"We are also investing heavily into training as well as modernizing our defense strategies to prioritize the use of asymmetrical capabilities, so that they more closely correspond with the realities of the threat we face,\" Tsai said. \"Altogether, I hope that these actions will ensure that the people of Taiwan remain able to choose our own futures, free of coercion.\"Tsai, who says she will seek a second four-year term next year, said Taiwan was also stepping-up training as it prepared to transition to an all-volunteer force and pointed to three consecutive years of defense budget increases.\"These funds have been directed into programs that will make a real difference in Taiwan's defense, including asymmetrical capabilities,\" she said.Tsai's unofficial Hawaii visit comes at the end of a trip to the Pacific island nations of Palau, Nauru, and the Marshall Islands, three of Taiwan's dwindling number of allies that now total just 17 as Beijing seeks to increase Taiwan's international isolation. The sides separated amid civil war in 1949.Beijing has cut contacts with Tsai's government over Tsai's refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan is a part of China. It has also stepped up efforts at military intimidation, such as circling the island with bombers and fighters in what are officially termed training missions.Elsewhere in remarks carried by satellite link to the conservative Washington think tank the Heritage Foundation, Tsai said she found developments in Hong Kong \"deeply concerning.\" China has touted Hong Kong as a future model Taiwan under what it calls \"one country, two systems.\"Critics say the semi-autonomous territory's civil liberties have been gradually eroded since it was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\"Hong Kong is a reminder that all politicians in Taiwan, regardless of politically parties, should carefully avoid falling into a trap laid by China, which includes economic incentives and other promises but ultimately leads to the same destination that is one country two system,\" Tsai said.", "2 execs arrested for fraud; links to Nigerian crime group suspected,By TATSURO SUGIURA/ Staff Writer,March,28,2019": "Two Japanese company executives were arrested March 28 on suspicion of fraud and concealing criminal revenues, with police seeking a possible connection between the pair and a Nigerian crime organization.Yoshitake Kurita, 53, of Tokyo, and Kimio Kawase, 58, of Osaka, are alleged to have withdrawn money obtained through a business e-mail scam that has spread globally, the Metropolitan Police Department announced the same day.The pair are believed to have conspired with a still-unknown third party in September 2016 to take over the e-mail address of the president of a company based in Saint Christopher and Nevis, an island nation in the West Indies.The suspects are believed to have sent an e-mail from the address to the Swiss bank used by the West Indies firm with instructions to transfer about 110 million yen ($998,000) to an account at a shinkin bank in Tokyo's Adachi Ward held in the name of the company where Kurita was an officer.Sources said the two withdrew the transferred money and concealed it.Although the two have admitted to the crime, police are looking into a wider connection with a Nigerian group known as Black Axe.The Metropolitan Police Department has cooperated with the FBI since last year to try to uncover the organization involved in a string of cases.Last year, the department nabbed two Nigerian men living in Osaka who are believed to have used a similar ploy.In that case, the e-mail addresses connected to companies in Thailand and the United States were taken over and e-mails were sent with instructions to transfer payments to an account at a regional bank in Sendai.Sources said the account was held in the name of a Japanese male residing in the city. Following the instructions of the two Nigerians, the man withdrew the money, placed it in a suitcase and delivered it to the two at Kansai International Airport. On other occasions, the Sendai man transferred the money to another account.Police believe the two Nigerians took the money with them on their frequent trips back home. Investigations into them led to suspicions that the Black Axe organization was somehow involved.According to police sources, Black Axe is suspected of not only e-mail scams, but also being involved in prostitution and drug smuggling.Sources said bank accounts in Asia, including China and Hong Kong, are frequently used as destinations for the money transfers to take advantage of the time difference, the aim being to withdraw the money from the Asian bank accounts before the victimized companies in the United States and elsewhere in the West become aware of the suspicious transfers.", "Taiwan president, seeking tanks and fighters, says U.S. responding positively,REUTERS,March,28,2019": "WASHINGTON-- Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday the United States was responding positively to Taipei's requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of growing pressure from China.Speaking during a stopover in Hawaii at the end of a Pacific tour, Tsai told Washington's Heritage Foundation think tank via videolink that Taiwan had submitted new requests to the United States for M-1 Abrams tanks and F-16B fighter jets.These, she said, \"would greatly enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen military morale and show to the world the U.S. commitment to Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense.\"The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself and is its main source of arms. On Sunday, Washington sent Navy and Coast Guard ships through the narrow strait separating the island from the mainland, part of an increase in the frequency of U.S. movement through the strategic waterway to show support for Taipei.Tsai said mounting pressure from China for Taiwan to accept a \"one country, two systems model\" and its attempts to alter the cross-straits status quo underscored the need for Taiwan to \"increase our self defense and deterrence capabilities.\"\"Fortunately ... Taiwan does not stand alone,\" she said. \"The United States' commitment to Taiwan is stronger than ever.\"Tsai said she felt the process of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan had become less politicized, adding: \"We are able to have frank discussions with the U.S. on the right equipment for Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense and the U.S. is responding positively to our request.\"She said big-ticket defense items would be managed though a special budget and Taiwan's regular defense budget would \"increase based on challenges coming across the strait.\"Tsai's Pacific tour has come amid heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, which has stepped up diplomatic and military pressure to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan.China suspects Tsai and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party of pushing for the island's formal independence.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in January that Beijing reserved the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control, but would strive to achieve peaceful \"reunification.\"Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling by down its few remaining diplomatic allies.Tsai stressed that Taiwan sought positive relations with Beijing, but China needed to talk without preconditions. She said developments in Hong Kong were not encouraging.\"One country, two systems will become just one country,\" she said. \"The two systems do not seem to be respected that much. So I think the experience of Hong Kong teaches the Taiwanese a lot.\"Tsai said earlier this month that Taiwan has sent a request to the United States to buy an unspecified number of F-16s, a move that could add another irritant to Beijing-Washington ties.Last week, U.S. China hawk Peter Navarro, director of the White House's Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, wrote in the New York Times that Taiwan may soon buy 108 M-1 tanks.Tsai, who faces re-election in January, has repeatedly called for international support to defend Taiwan's democracy in the face of China's renewed threats.Her Hawaii stopover, a customary practice for Taiwanese presidents, has drawn criticism from Beijing.This week, Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation seeking to boost Taiwan ties, which among other things would direct the Pentagon to make efforts to include Taiwan in military training exercises and expresses congressional support for regular U.S. arms sales.Tsai visited three diplomatic allies in the Pacific, part of an effort to prevent Taiwan's 17 remaining allies from switching allegiance to China. Four of the six Pacific island nations aligned with Taiwan have elections this year.On Monday, Nauru's parliament passed a resolution supporting Taiwan's democracy and opposing Beijing's \"one-China\" policy after Tsai made a speech there. She also visited Palau and the Marshall Islands during her eight-day trip in which she offered support to the agriculture sectors of the island nations.", "China tech firms, seeking passion and energy, promote younger staff,REUTERS,March,25,2019": "HONG KONG/BEIJING--Chinese tech giants are in the hunt for young, energetic staff to take the place, in some cases, of veteran managers.The companies deny that the moves, which are worrying some older employees, reflect any discrimination based on age. Explicit age discrimination is illegal in many countries, though not in China.Chinese tech companies are known to prefer young workers, in part because of demands such as the so-called \"996\" schedule that asks employees to work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.On Thursday, Tencent Holdings confirmed plans to reshuffle 10 percent of its managers.\"Let some older members of management retire from their positions,\" Tencent Holdings President Martin Lau said. \"Their jobs will be taken up by younger people, new colleagues who may be more passionate.\"Asked to elaborate on the reshuffle, Tencent cited its annual report as stating its employment practice complies with laws and regulations and \"does not discriminate on the grounds of gender, ethnicity, race, disability, age, religious belief, sexual orientation or family status.\"Analysts said the move to promote younger managers is driven in part by the rise of a new generation of Chinese internet companies such as Pinduoduo and Bytedance, which are mostly run by entrepreneurs and engineers born in the 1980s or 1990s.\"The environment and external pressures are pushing these companies to reform, if the leadership is too old, it's easy for them to fall behind,\" said Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based tech analyst who used to work at Tencent and e-commerce giant JD.com Inc.\"In the U.S. and Europe you rarely see companies going through structural reform every other year, but it's quite common in China ... core leadership can be replaced within a very short amount of time.\"At Baidu, CEO Robin Li said in an internal letter--which the company made public--that it plans to accelerate efforts to become more youthful this year by promoting more workers born after 1980, and also announced an executive retirement plan.The first executive to leave under that plan is its president for new business, Zhang Yaqin, who will retire in October, Li said. Local media reported Zhang's age as 53.\"For senior managers which have worked hard for the company and accompanied its growth, if they want to choose a new life because of personal or family reasons, we will take care of them under the executive retirement plan,\" Li wrote.A Baidu spokesman said that age is not a factor in whether managers chose to retire or not and that it was up to them if they wanted to join the plan.Lei Jun, chief of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, said at a news conference on March 20 that the company was appointing new, younger general department managers as part of an organizational restructuring.A Xiaomi spokesman said the company was not cutting the senior management team but that it needed to promote \"younger talents\" to support its rapid expansion.Chinese tech workers in their 30s and 40s said they had come to accept the industry's preference for youth but worried that it was becoming more extreme, especially in up-and-coming fields such as artificial intelligence. \"I'm not worrying so much about losing my job, but certainly there is worry that I will not get promoted,\" said a 38-year-old engineer at JD.com. Like other employees interviewed for this story, he declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.A JD.com spokeswoman said it did not discriminate and that any high-performing employee is eligible for promotion.A 29-year-old female programmer for one of China's top short video platforms said ageism was of greater concern to women.\"It can take a longer time for women to progress to the better jobs, so the age restriction more heavily affects women,\" she said. \"There is definitely the feeling that if you are older, you won't understand the product.\"Older workers have few legal options.\"The only recourse Chinese workers have is if they're not properly compensated once they're laid off,\" said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labor rights group.While age discrimination is illegal in the United States, it is often hard to prove. Bias in favor of younger workers often shows itself openly in the Silicon Valley start-up scene, where investors often prefer to back entrepreneurs in their 20s and 30s.In China, some in the tech industry said older employees could still get ahead if they were top performers. At telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, known for an aggressive internal culture where everyone's contract is up for renewal every few years, one employee defended the approach as common in the industry. Huawei declined to comment.\"Companies are moving away from the traditional iron rice bowl type of mentality,\" he said.", "New Thai government may be unstable, short-lived,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,23,2019": "BANGKOK--Thailand's election Sunday is likely to produce a weak unstable government whether it's a civilian or military-backed party that cobbles together a coalition, setting off a new phase of uncertainty in a country that's a U.S. ally in Southeast Asia and one of the world's top tourist destinations.The election is Thailand's first since its military seized power from an elected government in May 2014. It was the conservative establishment's third major attempt by either military or legal coup to eradicate the influence of Thaksin Shinawatra, a tycoon who made his fortune in telecommunication and upended Thailand's politics with a populist political revolution nearly two decades ago.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who as army chief led the 2014 coup, is hoping to stay in power with a hybrid political system that relies on an appointed Senate and a 20-year national strategic plan to limit the power of political parties not aligned with the military.\"It will be unstable,\" said Prajak Kongkirati, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University. \"Whatever party wins, Prayuth or Thaksin's side, both governments will be weak and unstable,\" he said. \"The government can collapse within a year or a year and a half and we might have a new election quite soon.\"Prayuth's five years as junta leader have been marred by complaints of human rights violations and growing economic inequality. Thailand's ties with the U.S. cooled because of the coup and Prayuth is seeking greater international legitimacy with an election meant to provide the appearance of a return to democracy.If the junta had one success, it was reinforcing its claim to be protector of Thailand's monarchy, an institution at the heart of Thai society, following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016 after a reign of seven decades and the succession of his son Maha Vajiralongkorn.Critic say the new military-designed political system is intrinsically unstable because it is not accepted by all sides and will be the beginning of a new round of struggle in Thailand.The country's prime minister will not be directly elected by its 51 million voters. Instead 750 lawmakers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 500 from an elected lower house of parliament and 250 from a junta-appointed Senate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will decide by simple majority. The prime minister does not have to be a member of parliament.None of the major political parties is likely to have enough elected lawmakers to choose a prime minister and form a government outright. Chaotic outcomes, such as a military favored prime minister chosen with Senate backing that lacks a majority in the parliament, are possible.Sunday's vote is the latest episode in a sometimes violent political struggle that pits Thaksin's political machine against a conservative establishment led by the ultra-royalist military.Thaksin swept to power in 2001 with social welfare policies aimed at uplifting the majority rural poor. He lives in exile after he was ousted by a 2006 military coup and accused of abuse of power, corruption and self-enrichment. Some saw him as disrespectful to the monarchy.The 2014 coup ousted the government that was led by Thaksin's sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was the head of the Thaksin-allied Pheu Thai party at the time.On Friday, Thaksin hosted a glittering wedding reception in Hong Kong for his youngest daughter, causing a sensation and substantial media and online coverage in Thailand. Guests included the Thai king's sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, who last month made a spectacular but quickly aborted attempt to be a prime ministerial candidate for a small Thaksin-allied party.Though ostensibly a family affair, the ceremony's timing two days ahead of the election seemed to implicitly say: Don't forget me and my political allies when you go out to vote.The Pheu Thai party remains broadly popular, especially in the country's north and northeast, home to the majority of voters, and its current leader Sudarat Keyuraphan has urged all Thais to vote, hoping a high turnout will derail Prayuth's plans to stay in power.\"If Pheu Thai does reach the number needed to form a new government, it is unclear how the military leadership would respond,\" said John Ciorciari, a Southeast Asia expert at the University of Michigan.\"Regardless of the election result, it is unlikely to put an end to Thailand's protracted political crisis,\" he said.", "Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happy rating falls to 58th, \u00e2\u0080\u0098generosity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at low level,By GAKUSHI FUJIWARA/ Staff Writer,March,21,2019": "Japan is not such a happy place these days.A global scale of happiness issued by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network ranks Japan in 58th spot, its lowest showing to date, and Finland in the No. 1 position.The survey, released March 20, rated the happiness level of 156 countries and regions. Japan fell four notches from the previous survey released last year.Finland was followed by Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway in the seventh edition of the World Happiness Report.

Higher interest rates emerged as the second-biggest risk, outpacing a slowing Chinese economy.A total of 100 companies from a range of sectors responded to the survey, conducted from March 1-15 in 11 Asia-Pacific countries where 45 percent of the world's population live and 32 percent of global gross domestic product is generated.The United States and China have put on hold a planned escalation of their trade war pending negotiations, but the much-awaited conclusion of the latest round of talks has also been delayed even though remarks from the two sides have been optimistic.Global agencies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have said failure to resolve trade tension could further slow a downward-trending global economy.Regional powerhouses China, Japan and South Korea all saw exports fall last month, with China and South Korea suffering their worst annual declines in overseas sales in around three years.The index staying above the neutral point of 50 suggests companies in Asia are not expecting an imminent global recession, but languishing near multi-year lows indicates companies are exerting caution.\"We don't see a global hard landing as a likely scenario when we look at economic factors such as inflation and credit conditions,\" said Young Sun Kwon, economist at Nomura in Hong Kong. \"But there are big uncertainties in politics.\"Lessons from the 2008-2009 global financial meltdown have forced countries to strengthen economic defenses, but factors such as Britain's planned exit from the European Union and the U.S. Federal Reserve's uncertain path are posing threats.With less than two weeks before the March 29 divorce date, British Prime Minister Theresa May's government is still struggling to push a departure deal with the EU through the British parliament.In the United States, the Fed has declared a pause in its tightening campaign, but economists foresee at least one more increase later this year despite increasing signs of slowdown in major economies.Respondents to the survey included Canon Inc., Suzuki Motor Corp., Thai Beverage PCL, Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. and Delta Electronics Thailand PCL.Note: Companies surveyed can change from quarter to quarter.", "Malaysia to summons 2 Goldman Sachs units over 1MDB,REUTERS,March,18,2019": "KUALA LUMPUR--Malaysian prosecutors on Monday said they would issue summonses to units of U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs in London and Hong Kong, requiring them to respond by June to criminal charges filed against them last year.Soon after being elected in May 2018, a new government charged three units of Goldman Sachs for misleading investors by making untrue statements and omitting key facts in relation to bond issues totaling $6.5 billion (725 billion yen) for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).On Monday, only the Singapore unit of Goldman Sachs appeared at a pre-trial hearing in a Kuala Lumpur court as a respondent.\"Fresh summonses will be served on the United Kingdom and Hong Kong offices of Goldman Sachs ahead of the next court hearing on June 24,\" prosecutor Aaron Paul Chelliah told reporters.The 1MDB scandal played a major role in the electoral defeat that ended Najib Razak's near decade in power, and a new government led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad promptly re-opened corruption investigations.Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, is facing multiple criminal charges, mostly linked to 1MDB, and has been barred from leaving the country.The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs, including $600 million in fees paid to the bank for the bond issues.Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.A separate Kuala Lumpur court also set April 15 for prosecutors to serve documents to the defense for former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng.Ng, a Malaysian, was charged on Dec. 19 last year with abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for the 1MDB bond sales.Prosecutor Zaki Arsyad told the court he needed more time to obtain documents as most of them were overseas.Ng was originally set to be extradited to the United States to face money laundering charges filed against him by the DoJ.Malaysia, however, has said it may postpone the extradition until Ng can face a domestic trial first.Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB. Leissner has pleaded guilty.Low, whose whereabouts is unknown, has issued denials of any wrongdoing and has refused to return to Malaysia, saying that the case against him is politically motivated.", "Hong Kong, Taiwan activists wary of Chinese operatives,REUTERS,March,18,2019": "HONG KONG/TAIPEI--As Beijing grows wary of pro-independence groups seeking to forge closer ties in Hong Kong and Taiwan, activists say they are coming under increased surveillance and harassment from pro-China media outlets and unofficial \"operatives.\"Visits to Taiwan in January by several Hong Kong activists including Tony Chung generated heavy coverage by two pro-China newspapers, including detailed reports of their movements and meetings.The coverage prompted Taiwan to investigate the activities of the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao newspapers on \"national security\" grounds.The government found that the papers committed \"unlawful\" acts, including invasive surveillance, and spread \"fake news.\" Officials said journalists from those papers would be banned from traveling to Taiwan for up to three years if the media outlets did not provide a \"reasonable explanation\" for their activities there.A Reuters examination of both papers' articles show that at least 25 people linked to anti-China and independence causes have been the subject of intense coverage, including covert photography and the reporting of personal details, in Taiwan during the past three years.Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Such papers, which typically take a pro-Beijing stance, would be expected to pay close attention to activists pursuing causes that upset the Chinese government.But activists say their coverage stretches into the realm of harassment, including surveillance on overseas trips, and publishing details of their private lives, including homes, work and daily movements.\"It's obvious that there's intervention from outside forces with an aim to intimidate people,\" Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Minister Chiu Chui-cheng told Reuters, referring to the coverage from the pro-China papers.The coverage raised concerns about the activities of \"Chinese and Hong Kong intelligence operatives\" on the island, Chiu added, including people working for pro-China media outlets.Activists have also been physically attacked during trips to Taiwan.In July 2018, two Taiwanese were convicted of assaulting Hong Kong activists meeting with independence advocates in Taiwan. Three Hong Kong men were later named in Taiwanese media coverage as helping facilitate the attack.\"I was followed until I almost left the airport,\" Andy Chan, one of the Hong Kong activists, said of his time in Taiwan. \"There are operatives for China everywhere.\"China considers Hong Kong and Taiwan to be inalienable parts of its territory and has branded pro-independence activists on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as \"separatists.\"In an annual report to the U.S. Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission noted in November that since president Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016, Beijing has feared \"collusion between 'separatist forces' in Taiwan and Hong Kong.\"\"Beijing is trying everything in its power to prevent this,\" said a security source in the Taiwan government, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.The source and a second Taiwanese security official involved in national security say China has been quietly ramping up the number of intelligence operatives in Hong Kong and Taiwan.Wu Jieh-min, a Taiwan scholar who has researched civil movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan, says he was barred from entering Hong Kong for an academic conference in late 2016.Beijing is \"very worried about the exchange of ideas. If the ideas of civil society are not hindered, their power will be greatly enhanced,\" said Wu, a research fellow with the government-backed Academia Sinica.Wu noted that mass, protracted protests in Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2014 that railed against Chinese interference were a catalyst for deepening activist ties on both sides.China's Taiwan Affairs Office and main representative body in Hong Kong, the Liaison Office, did not respond to requests for comment.The Wen Wei Po has also paid close attention to foreigners in contact with Hong Kong activists.In December, Wen Wei Pao reporters and photographers covered the daily activities of Kevin Carrico, an Australia-based political scientist, during a visit to Hong Kong in which he met with independence advocates, and featured him on the front page.\"I was a little creeped out by the fact that the article discussed my presentation. There were only 15 people there,\" he said of a private meeting in the basement of a Hong Kong building.He said there had been \"a real escalation of Beijing's political operations in Hong Kong.\"Activists in Hong Kong and Taiwan describe an increase in unknown individuals shadowing their meetings and events, sometimes taking photographs or recording their conversations.In some cases activists have been attacked, and the assailants identified.Two Taiwanese, Zhang Xiuye and Jhang Jhih-min, were found guilty last July of a 2016 assault on two Hong Kong independence activists, Andy Chan and Jason Chow, at a Taipei hotel.Zhang and Jhang were convicted of defamation and fined T$6,000 ($195 or 21,762 yen) and T$8,000 ($260) respectively; Jhang was also found guilty of \"intimidating and endangering the safety\" of Chan.Zhang and Jhang were among at least eight people who beat Chan and Chow and called them China \"traitors\" at the Caesar Park Hotel, according to Taipei court documents.Chan told Reuters he was at the hotel to meet with Ouyang Jin, a journalist with a little-known Hong Kong publication called Pacific Magazine.Zhang is a senior member of the Chinese Concentric Patriotism Party, which advocates unification of China and Taiwan, according to the group's website.\"It was purely an accident\" that they ran into Chan at the hotel, Zhang told Reuters.", "China's moves on foreign investment help shore up markets,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,16,2019": "LONDON--Hopes that the U.S. and China will resolve their trade dispute as Beijing tweaked rules on foreign investment has helped shore up global stock markets on Friday.Following a week dominated by Brexit uncertainty, traders focused on the annual session of China's ceremonial congress, which ended with Premier Li Keqiang pledging support for the slowing economy.The congress endorsed a law aimed at defusing a tariff war with Washington by discouraging Chinese officials from pressuring companies to hand over technology.

Parliament voted, following weeks of political gridlock, to seek an extension from the European Union over the country's exit from the bloc to avoid a chaotic withdrawal on the scheduled exit date of March 29.Power to approve or reject the extension lies with the EU, which has signaled that it will only allow a delay if Britain either approves a divorce deal or makes a fundamental shift in its approach to Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to ask EU leaders for an extension at a March 21-22 summit of the bloc in Brussels after she tries again to win support from lawmakers for her deal after two resounding defeats.\"Any respite to the intensity of Brexit is going to be fleeting, for despite the lack of any major economic events today, we are now looking towards another meaningful vote next week,\" said IG's Mahony.Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent to 11,693 while the CAC 40 in France was 0.9 percent higher too at 5,398.

It opposes Taiwan independence and says it seeks a \"peaceful reunification.\"President Xi Jinping did not rule out the use of force during a January speech on cross-strait relations, in which he proposed a \"one country, two systems\" approach akin to China's current arrangement with the former British colony of Hong Kong.The suggestion was rejected by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who said China must accept the existence of the Republic of Taiwan.Last year, China introduced \"31 Measures\" aiming to woo Taiwan residents.

That includes inducements for Taiwanese to live and work in China by offering them local legal status, appealing especially to young creatives and technology workers frustrated by Taiwan's small market and stagnant wages.It has backed that up with a drive to poach away Taiwan's dwindling number of diplomatic allies, leaving it with just 17, blocking its participation in international gatherings and stepping-up its saber rattling through war games and threatening statements from leading military figures.Those include president and ruling Communist Party Xi, who commands the armed forces, and in a January address renewed the threat of military action against the island. He received further endorsement from members of the Beijing-appointed Taiwan delegation to this month's annual meeting of China's ceremonial legislature, none of whom come from Taiwan or have any more than tenuous connections to the island.Xi \"will not allow (unification) to be postponed indefinitely,\" Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper quoted delegate Cai Peihui as saying.China's strategy and impatience with Tsai's administration among Taiwanese voters seems to be having an effect. The DPP took a beating in November's local elections, and public opinion surveys put her approval rating at around 25 percent.While Taiwanese increasingly favor closer economic ties and exchanges with Taiwan, the island's 23 million residents as a whole remain overwhelmingly opposed to political unification with China.Although the United States cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China 40 years ago, it remains a strong Taiwanese ally and is legally committed to consider threats to the island a matter of deep concern.Support for Taiwan has remained strong under U.S. President Donald Trump and the island's request for new warplanes and other armaments have been seen as receiving a friendly reception in Washington, which is at loggerheads with Beijing over trade and other issues.", "U.S. envoy calls China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Muslim camps \u00e2\u0080\u0098horrific,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wants probe,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,12,2019": "TAIPEI--Describing China's internment of an estimated 1 million Muslims as a \"horrific situation,\" a U.S. envoy on religion called Tuesday for an independent investigation into the detentions and for the release of those being held.Sam Brownback, U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, said China has done nothing to assuage concerns from the United States and others over the detention of Uighurs, Kazakhs and members of other Muslim minority groups.\"We've been putting out very clearly that this is a horrific situation that's taking place in Xinjiang,\" Brownback said in a telephone news conference with reporters, referring to the northwestern region that is home to most Chinese Muslims.\"It is just a very tragic and I think a horrific situation there,\" he said.China has already angrily protested Brownback's earlier remarks last week in Hong Kong criticizing Beijing's polices toward religious minorities and accusing the country of being \"at war with faith.\"China's officially atheist Communist government at first denied the existence of the internment camps in Xinjiang, but now says they are vocational training facilities aimed at countering Muslim radicalism and separatist tendencies.China says Xinjiang has long been its territory and claims it is bringing prosperity and development to the vast, resource-rich region. Many among Xinjiang's native ethnic groups say they are being denied economic options in favor of migrants from elsewhere in China and that their Muslim faith and unique culture and language are being gradually eradicated.The camps sprang up over the past two years at extraordinary speed and on a massive scale, as monitored by satellite imagery. China maintains a massive security presence in Xinjiang and efforts to independently verify claims by Uighur activists are routinely blocked.Brownback appeared undeterred by Beijing's complaints over his earlier comments, describing China's explanation of the reasons behind the camps as \"completely unsatisfactory answers.\"China is already listed by the U.S. among the worst violators of religious freedom, and Brownback held open the possibility of sanctions and other punitive measures \"if corrective actions aren't taken.\"While making no commitments, Brownback held open the possibility of action toward individuals involved in the internments under The Global Magnitsky Act of 2016.The act makes it possible to impose entry bans and targeted sanctions on individuals for committing human rights violations or acts of significant corruption.Brownback also contrasted Beijing's attacks on religion with the tolerant approach of governments such as that of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that China claims as its own territory.

The company has spent years trying to put to rest accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or is controlled by the ruling Communist Party.\"We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\" the company's chairman, Guo Ping, said in a statement. \"This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers.\"Huawei has about 40 percent of the global market for network gear but its U.S. sales evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 cited the company and a Chinese competitor, ZTE Corp., as security risks and told phone carriers to avoid dealing with them.Huawei complains U.S. authorities have released no evidence. Washington's campaign to persuade allies to shun Huawei threatens to block access to major markets as phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in fifth-generation equipment.Huawei says the new law would shrink its potential U.S. market further by prohibiting the government from buying the Chinese vendor's technology and from buying goods or services from or giving grants or loans to companies or other third parties that do. The United States accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the global market for computer and telecom technology.The company is challenging the U.S. law as an unconstitutional \"bill of attainder,\" or a measure that targets a specific individual for penalties without a trial. The company says that infringes its due process rights and improperly has Congress play the role of a court.The ban is \"based on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions,\" said Song Liuping, the company's chief legal officer, in the statement. \"Huawei has an excellent security record and program. No contrary evidence has been offered.\"The Chinese government has accused Washington of fabricating or exaggerating security concerns to block a successful Chinese competitor.Huawei, based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, is a leading developer of 5G along with rivals Nokia Corp. of Finland and Sweden's LM Ericsson. Industry analysts say excluding the Chinese vendor from markets for 5G equipment would reduce competition and might lead to higher prices.\"The restrictions on Huawei will stifle competition, leaving U.S. consumers paying higher prices for inferior products,\" said the company statement.Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, overtook Ericsson in 2017 as the biggest global supplier of network gear. It says it supplies 45 of the world's top 50 phone companies and has contracts with 30 carriers to test 5G wireless technology.European governments are balking at U.S. pressure to ban Huawei. The company has announced contracts with customers including the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East for network technology.In January, U.S. prosecutors filed charges accusing Huawei of stealing trade secrets and its chief financial officer of lying to banks about dealings with Iran.The executive, Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of the company's founder, was arrested Dec. 1 by Canadian authorities and is fighting a U.S. extradition request.China's government arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.On Monday, the government accused the two men of acting together to steal state secrets. That followed the Canadian government's announcement Friday that the extradition proceeding would be allowed to continue.Huawei executives deny wrongdoing and say American security warnings have yet to affect sales outside the United States. The company's 2018 revenue forecast is $100 billion (11 trillion yen) and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, said last month this year's target is $125 billion.Some European officials and others cite a Chinese security law that requires companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies. They say Huawei and other tech companies might be required to install \"backdoors\" in equipment to allow eavesdropping.Huawei denies altering its equipment to facilitate spying and has set up testing centers in Britain, Canada and continental Europe to allow governments to examine its technology.Thursday's statement called Huawei \"the most open, transparent, and scrutinized company in the world.\"The company also has launched a public relations campaign abroad. Its typically press-shy founder, Ren, gave a two-hour interview to foreign reporters in January in which he said Huawei would reject Chinese government demands to disclose confidential information about its customers. Since then, Ren also has talked at length with foreign TV broadcasters.", "Meaningful U.S.-China trade deal could be hard to reach,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,March,6,2019": "WASHINGTON--Under U.S. President Donald Trump, America's trade deficit with China has so far worsened. That gap represents an unfulfilled Trump pledge just as talks between the world's two largest economies may be nearing a potential deal to suspend their trade war.Despite signals from Chinese and U.S. officials that some truce could soon be at hand, there are few signs of any truly transformed trade relationship. Beijing's longstanding policy of subsidizing its own businesses and charges that it illicitly obtains U.S. technology remain key obstacles.During the first 11 months of 2018, America's trade deficit in goods with China--the gap between the value of U.S. goods that China buys and the higher value of what it sells to the United States--swelled to a record $382 billion (43 trillion yen). And a government report to be released Wednesday is expected to show the U.S. deficit with China reaching a new high above $400 billion.A senior Trump administration official asserted that progress had been made during trade talks over the past two weeks, only to acknowledge that the eventual outcome remains a mystery and that China faced no timetable for responding to the U.S. priorities. The official insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.U.S. and Chinese officials have hinted that some kind of agreement could be finalized by the end of March, with Trump and President Xi Jinping possibly meeting to formalize the deal at Trump's private club in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.For its part, Beijing is publicly expressing its intent to crack down on policies that have long enabled Chinese companies and local government officials to force American and other foreign businesses to share their technology as the price of admission to the vast Chinese market. But such public pledges represent far less than the enforceable commitments to reform such policies that U.S. negotiators are seeking.Last year, Trump imposed a series of tariffs on Chinese goods in hopes of pressuring Beijing to support more favorable terms for the United States. In June, the White House levied import taxes of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese imports. It followed in September with 10 percent duties on an additional $200 billion. All told, the U.S. tariffs covered roughly half of what the United States buys from China.But the blowback from the Trump tariffs--and China's retaliatory import taxes on U.S. goods--has been steady, at home and abroad. Many businesses are now paying higher costs to import electrical components and other goods from China that aren't made in the United States. The duties cost consumers $1.4 billion a month and businesses $3 billion a month by the end of last year, according to research released last week by Mary Amiti, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and economists from Princeton and Columbia universities.And a survey led by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that the tariffs had caused U.S. companies to cut their spending on large equipment by 1.2 percent, or $32.5 billion, last year.Both figures are relatively modest, given that the U.S. economy produces $20 trillion of goods and services a year. But there are also secondary effects. The stock market plummeted 19 percent last fall, partly on fears that the trade war would inflict severe damage.Nor have the tariffs provided the negotiating leverage that Trump sought. Many of China's concessions appear designed to appease some U.S. concerns, rather than establish guidelines for trade that each country would be bound to follow.Beijing has offered to buy more American farm goods and energy--a pitch that Xi made to Trump when they met during a December dinner at a global conference in Buenos Aires with the idea of narrowing the U.S. trade gap with China.China's ceremonial legislature was poised this week to back a law that would discourage officials in the country from pressuring U.S. companies to hand over technology. It was a response to concerns about Chinese disrespect for intellectual property that Trump had raised when he first imposed import taxes on Chinese goods.But it's unclear whether China would actually enforce this commitment--a concern that could potentially prevent a meaningful trade agreement. Speaking to a House panel last week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said, \"I can point to many examples\" of Beijing signing onto an agreement \"and in very few cases have they actually kept their obligations.\"Lighthizer also stressed that it wouldn't be enough for Beijing to agree to additional purchases of American soybeans, natural gas another goods. Any far-reaching agreement, he said, would need to include changes in China's policies toward intellectual property protection, forced technology transfer and the subsidization of Chinese companies.Erin Ennis, vice president at the U.S.-China Business Council, said that agreeing on an enforcement mechanism is a huge challenge. The Trump administration wants to be able to impose tariffs on China if it violated its promises in any future pact--without retaliation. Yet Beijing would likely regard such a mechanism as infringing on its sovereignty.But without enforcement, \"it's difficult to see how they will conclude a deal,\" Ennis said.Beijing is also resisting U.S. demands to change industrial policies, said Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. And instead of pulling back on support for technology development, Premier Li Keqiang, in his report to the national legislature on 2019 government goals, promised even more such support.\"The Chinese will never agree to compromise on this, because it is key to the country's future,\" Lam said. \"The whole socialist approach to high-tech innovation involves the state playing a big role. The Chinese will never give this up.\"That said, China does appear at least open to prying open more of its financial sector, which has largely been closed off to U.S. and European banks.\"What is certain is that in opening up the financial sector, China and the United States can fully agree on each other,\" Guo Shuqing, the chairman of China's banking regulator, told reporters Tuesday.", "Rights group says China arrests at least 3 labor activists,REUTERS,February,28,2019": "SHANGHAI--At least three prominent labor activists in China have been formally arrested on public order charges, a Hong Kong-based labor rights organization said, the latest step by Chinese authorities in a rolling crackdown on civil society.The three--Wu Guijun, Zhang Zhiru and He Yuancheng--have been in detention in the southern city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, for more than a month, the China Labor Bulletin said.They learned on Tuesday and Wednesday that they were being formally charged with \"gathering a crowd to disturb public order,\" it said.\"The authorities are clearly nervous about the ability of labor activists to organize workers who are already struggling to make a living and increasingly angry at the gross social inequality they see around them every day,\" CLB said in a statement.It said it was unclear what incident the charges referred to because the authorities had told Wu and Zhang to decline the services of the lawyers hired by their families. It also said family members had been harassed and told not to talk to the media about the case.Shenzhen police did not have an immediate comment about the arrests when contacted by phone.Two other activists were detained on Jan. 20 along with Zhang, He and Wu, CLB said. \"Given that they have yet to reappear in public, it is assumed that they have been arrested and charged as well,\" it said.Labor activists in China have long been under pressure from the ruling Communist Party, which is deeply suspicious of social organizing that occurs outside of its control, but authorities have sharply intensified their efforts in recent years.", "Trump-Kim summit to have \u00e2\u0080\u0098maximum level\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,February,25,2019": "HANOI--With North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on an armored train barreling through China toward Vietnam's capital, and U.S. President Donald Trump about to board a jet for Hanoi, Vietnamese officials scrambled Monday to finish preparations for a rushed summit that will capture global attention.Officials in Hanoi said they had about 10 days to prepare for the summit--much less than the nearly two months they said Singapore was given for the first Trump-Kim meeting last year--but still vowed to provide airtight security for the two leaders.\"Security will be at the maximum level,\" Vietnamese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Hoai Trung told reporters at a briefing meant to showcase the nation's efforts to welcome Kim and Trump.Another official, Nguyen Manh Hung, the leader of the information ministry, said the 3,000 journalists from 40 countries expected in Hanoi could rely on his agency as \"you'd count on a family member.\"The world will be watching as Trump and Kim deal with one of Asia's biggest security challenges: North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear program that stands on the verge of viably threatening any target on the planet.Although many experts are skeptical that Kim will give up the nukes he likely sees as his best guarantee of continued rule, there was a palpable, carnival-like excitement among many in Hanoi as the final preparations were put in place.T-shirts were being sold bearing Kim's face along with the phrase \"Rocket Man,\" a nod to the insulting nickname Trump gave Kim in 2017, when North Korean weapons tests and back-and-forth threats by the leaders had many fearing war. Kindergarteners dressed in traditional Korean Hanbok were practicing songs meant to welcome Kim. Grinning tourists were posing in front of the hundreds of U.S. and North Korean flags around the city.The ultra-tight security will be appreciated by North Korean authorities, who are extremely vigilant about the safety of Kim, the third member of his family to rule the North with absolute power. Kim's decision to take a train, not a plane, may have been influenced by better ability to control security. When Kim flew to Singapore, North Korea borrowed a Chinese plane.Vietnam is eager to show off its huge economic and development improvements since the destruction of the Vietnam War, but the country also tolerates no dissent and is able to provide the kind of firm hand not allowed by more democratic potential hosts.Take the reaction to two men impersonating Kim and Trump who'd been posing for pictures with curious onlookers ahead of the summit.Last week, the Kim lookalike, whose name is Lee Howard Ho Wun, posted on Facebook that about 15 police or immigration officers demanded a mandatory \"interview\" and threatened him with deportation. He said officials later told him that his visa was invalid and he had to leave the country.\"I feel a little bit annoyed,\" the Hong Kong-based impersonator, who uses the name Howard X, said as he checked out of his hotel. \"But what is to be expected of a one-party state with no sense of humor?\"Vietnam has also announced an unprecedented traffic ban along a possible arrival route for Kim. The Communist Party's Nhan Dan newspaper quoted the Roads Department as saying the ban will affect the 169-kilometer stretch of Highway One from Dong Dang, on the border with China, to Hanoi.Hundreds of soldiers guarded the area near the Dong Dang railway station on Monday ahead of Kim's expected arrival. Kim may get off his train in Dong Dang and finish his journey to Hanoi by car.There are high expectations for the Hanoi summit after a vague declaration at the first meeting in June in Singapore that disappointed many.In a meeting with senior aides in Seoul, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday that the Trump-Kim talks would be a critical opportunity to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula.Moon, who met Kim three times last year and has lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, is eager for a breakthrough that would allow him to push ambitious plans for inter-Korean engagement, including lucrative joint economic projects that are held back by U.S.-led sanctions against the North.\"If President Trump succeeds in dissolving the world's last remaining Cold War rivalry, it will become yet another great feat that will be indelibly recorded in world history,\" Moon said.Trump, via Twitter, has worked to temper those expectations, predicting before leaving for Hanoi a \"continuation of the progress\" made in Singapore but adding a tantalizing nod to \"Denuclearization?\" He also said that Kim knows that \"without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World.\"North Korea has spent decades, at great political and economic sacrifice, building its nuclear program, and there is widespread skepticism among experts that it will give away that program cheaply.South Korean media have reported that Trump and Kim might strike a deal that stops short of a hoped-for roadmap for full North Korean denuclearization.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he was hoping for a \"substantive step forward.\" He cautioned, \"it may not happen, but I hope that it will.\"", "China unveils plans to develop Hong Kong, Macao bay area,REUTERS,February,19,2019": "BEIJING--China's Cabinet on Monday issued guidelines for developing a \"Greater Bay Area\" around the Pearl River Delta, in a bid to spur growth in Guangdong province and the cities of Hong Kong and Macao.The area is home to some 68 million people and has a combined gross domestic product of about $1.5 trillion (166 trillion yen), roughly equivalent to that of Australia or South Korea.The development plans will \"further enhance and support a leading role of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in national economic development and opening up,\" the State Council, or Cabinet, said in the guidelines.The overall plan, which includes long-term goals through 2035, is to turn the Greater Bay Area into a global technology innovation center and build advanced manufacturing and modern services industries, the Cabinet said.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam welcomed the plan.\"It can help identify new areas of growth for Hong Kong and foster the diversified development of its economy and industries,\" the Hong Kong government said.The area, which covers nine cities in Guangdong, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, will also promote \"coordinated development and create a model for high quality development,\" China's Cabinet said.Authorities will expand and upgrade airports in the four core cities of Hong Kong, Macao, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and accelerate construction of large-scale oil reserve bases in the Pearl River Delta area, it said.Financial institutions in the Greater Bay Area will be allowed to conduct spot and forward yuan trading and yuan derivatives transactions as well as cross-border yuan lending, it said.Companies in the Greater Bay Area would be allowed to issue yuan-denominated bonds within the area, it said.Peter Wong, deputy chairman and chief executive of HSBC's Asia Pacific operations, said the latest plan will help leverage the strengths of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in the technology, financial and tourism industries.\"With the direction given by this policy, cities and regions in the Greater Bay Area can develop plans to leverage those complementary strengths more effectively,\" Wong said.", "Macao police probe suspected murder at Sands casino resort,REUTERS,February,18,2019": "HONG KONG--Police in the world's biggest gambling hub of Macao are investigating what they suspect is a rare murder in a five-star casino resort after a Chinese man was found stabbed in his bed, broadcaster TDM reported on Monday.Murder cases have been rare in the Chinese territory since Portugal ceded control of what had been a colonial backwater on the heel of China's southern coast 20 years ago.The suspected murder took place in Sands China's Conrad Macao hotel, TDM reported, citing police. It comes as slower mainland growth, a weaker yuan and a simmering trade war with the United States threaten to derail Macao's growth.The 41-year-old victim, an active gambler from the mainland, had been stabbed. The case was being investigated and no further details were available, TDM said.Macao police and Sands China did not respond to requests for comment. The company is controlled by U.S. billionaire Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands.Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Casino revenues shrank in January for the first time in more than two years.Violent crime in Macao has often been linked to its junket operators--the middlemen who bring China's wealthiest to the gambling tables. Slower growth and tighter regulations have made it hard for many small junket companies to stay in business.Criminal gangs known as triads, which are known to operate in Macao, are typically involved in extortion, money laundering, murder and prostitution.", "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders want more babies, but local officials resist,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,February,18,2019": "BEIJING--Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.The move has sparked public outrage as people vent their anger at population control officials who are hungry for revenue and have long persecuted couples for violating the now-scrapped \"one-child policy.\"\"The country is doing all it can to encourage childbirth but the local governments need money, so we end with this sort of madness,\" a columnist and political commentator who writes under the name Lianpeng said on China's Weibo microblogging service.\"The low birthrate has everyone on edge, yet the local governments care only about collecting fees,\" journalist Jin Wei wrote on her verified Weibo account. \"I don't know of any other nation that pulls its people in different directions like this.\"The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a \"social maintenance fee\" of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400 or 375,808 yen) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.\"I just don't know what I'm going to do,\" the husband, Wang Baohua, was quoted as saying by local media last week.The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious \"one-child policy\" came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply--within limits.But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion--a growth rate of .381 percent and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.China, with an estimated fertility rate of 1.02 in 2018, now finds itself in the same category as other predominantly Chinese societies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore, Yi said. Average fertility rates in those regions and countries from 2005 to 2017 were 1.10, 1.12, 1.08 and 1.23 respectively.Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding--15-30 percent--and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.Thus far, the National Health Commission has rejected calls to eliminate legal references to family planning, citing among other reasons article 25 of China's Constitution, which says, \"The state promotes family planning so that population growth may fit the plans for economic and social development.\"Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.\"Other things have taken the place of children, like apartments and vacations. My parents put pressure on us, but I just say it's not possible right now,\" said a government employee who asked to be identified only as Linda.Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.\"It will be very difficult,\" he said. \"Of course, the premise is to respect human rights and withdraw the government's hands from the people's bodies.\"", "Sweden probing its envoy to China over \u00e2\u0080\u0098threatening\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meeting,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,February,15,2019": "BEIJING--Sweden's ambassador to China is under internal investigation over a meeting she arranged between the daughter of a detained Swedish publisher and two Chinese businessmen who she says threatened her father.Ambassador Anna Lindstedt returned to Stockholm on Wednesday to meet with officials from the foreign affairs ministry, the Swedish Embassy in Beijing said by phone. Lindstedt is not under criminal investigation.The ministry later confirmed that Lindstedt's departure was related to meetings she arranged between Angela Gui, the daughter of detained Swedish book publisher Gui Minhai, and the two businessmen.\"The ambassador has acted incorrectly in the sense that the foreign ministry had no knowledge that the meetings took place,\" spokeswoman Catherine Johnsson told The Associated Press. She said the internal investigation was aimed at getting \"an overall picture of what has happened,\" and that \"as far as the action of the ambassador is concerned, we must wait for what the inquiry will come up with.\"Angela Gui published an account Wednesday in which she described the meetings as \"strange.\" She wrote on Medium, an online publishing platform, that the businessmen threatened her after initially offering to help secure her father's release from prison in China.Gui Minhai, a naturalized Swedish citizen, co-owned a Hong Kong store which sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders.Gui, 53, went missing in 2015 from his seaside home in Thailand, turning up months later on Chinese television saying he had turned himself in for an alleged 2003 drunken driving accident in which a female college student was killed.Several of Gui's colleagues from his Hong Kong publishing house also went missing in quick succession, sparking suspicions that mainland security forces were seeking to snuff out independent voices in the semi-autonomous city.Gui was released in October after completing a two-year sentence, but committed to remaining in Ningbo, where he was born, until an investigation was completed into charges of running a business illegally.In January 2018, he was taken off a train by Chinese police while in the presence of two Swedish diplomats with whom he was traveling to Beijing. Sweden said its officials were taking him to seek medical treatment. China said Gui was being investigated for leaking state secrets.Gui later told pro-Beijing media outlets that he never wished to leave China and that Sweden was using his case to \"create trouble\" for China's government. The statement from Gui, who spoke in a detention facility flanked by police, was immediately denounced by rights activists as coerced.Angela Gui is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge who has become a self-described \"accidental activist\" for her father. She wrote in her Wednesday post that the role has landed her in a \"fair number of bizarre situations,\" but few of the same magnitude as her encounter with Lindstedt and the businessmen.She said Lindstedt convinced her to fly to Stockholm on Jan. 24 to explore a \"new approach\" to her father's case. During a two-day meeting with the businessmen and Lindstedt, she said, the businessmen told her they could arrange a Chinese visa and job for her and that they had connections within China's ruling Communist Party.They then told her they had already started to negotiate over her father's case without her prior knowledge, according to Angela Gui. One businessman said it was possible that Gui Minhai would be released, but only if Angela Gui promised to stop publicizing her father's case for a month.Gui wrote that one of the men told her, \"You have to trust me, or you will never see your father again.\"She later learned that no one at the Swedish foreign ministry had been informed of the meeting.\"I'm not going to be quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father 'might' be released,\" she wrote. \"Threats, verbal abuse, bribes, or flattery won't change that.\"In Sweden, Jonas Sjostedt, a lawmaker for the pro-government Left Party, accused the ambassador of \"trying to silence the daughter of a Swede who is a political prisoner in China.\"\"Someone who is representing Sweden has instead been running errands for a foreign power,\" he said Wednesday on Swedish broadcaster SVT TV.Sweden announced last month--prior to the incident described by Gui--that Lindstedt was leaving the Beijing post to become ambassador to the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. She was to start in the new position in March.Sweden's relations with China were also roiled last year by Beijing's demands for punishment, compensation and an apology over an incident in which Swedish police removed an elderly couple and their son from a hotel on Sept. 2 after they arrived a day before their booking and refused the staff's requests to leave.", "Hong Kong snares record haul of rhino horns from S. Africa,REUTERS,February,15,2019": "HONG KONG--Hong Kong customs seized a record 40 kilograms of rhino horns worth around HK$8 million ($1 million or 110 million yen) from Johannesburg en route to Vietnam, the latest bust for authorities trying to tackle the rising volume of endangered species trafficked through the Chinese territory.The seizure came less than one month after customs busted a massive smuggling operation from Africa, seizing a record quantity of pangolin scales, along with more than 1,000 ivory tusks.Customs said the rhino horns were found in two check-in carton boxes, destined for Ho Chi Minh City. Two men were arrested, they said in a statement on Thursday, adding it was a record haul for airline passengers.\"It's shocking to us that today's 40 kg rhino horn seizure equates to about 20 percent of the total amount of rhino horn seized in Hong Kong from 2013 to the end of October 2018,\" conservation group WildAid said.The former British colony on China's southern coast is one of the world's primary wildlife trafficking transit points, supplying an array of wildlife products including shark's fin and rhino horn across Asia and particularly mainland China.Much of the trade supplies the traditional Chinese medicine sector.

There are under 29,000 rhinos alive in the wild and in captivity.China has made significant strides in wildlife protection in recent years but it also has formidable profit driven wildlife business interests.After pressure from some breeders, China's State Council said in October that it would replace a 1993 ban on the trade of tiger bones and rhino horn, opening up exceptions under \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial circumstances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including medical research.But in November, Beijing postponed the move following widespread protest from conservation groups.Hong Kong authorities last year raised penalties for smuggling endangered species to a maximum fine of HK$10 million and a 10 year prison sentence.

The decision to cancel my visa was based on unfounded speculations that are prejudiced and groundless,\" Huang told the Australian Financial Review.\"There are many Australian companies in China, aren't they more likely to be susceptible to potential manipulation by the Chinese government?\" he said.Representatives for Australia's Department of Home Affairs and a spokeswoman for Minister for Immigration David Coleman did not respond immediately to requests for comment.China's foreign ministry, in a short statement read over the telephone to Reuters, said it did not know anything about the issue, but that China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.Huang's expulsion comes as Australia and China seek to repair ties that have been strained since 2017, when Canberra accused Beijing of meddling in its domestic affairs. China denies the accusation.Huang emerged as one of Australia's biggest political donors soon after he began living in Australia. He rose to prominence after an influential opposition lawmaker was forced to resign in 2017, when allegations emerged that he was linked to Chinese-aligned interests.The lawmaker, Sam Dastyari, sought to encourage a senior politician not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing's rule in Hong Kong in 2015.Dastyari was also recorded warning Huang that his phone may be tapped.Huang stopped political donations after that incident but later expanded his business interests in Australia.

Since we announced on February 1 that we will go on strike, we were expecting a positive response,\" union leader Chen Pei-pei told reporters.The union is calling for an additional backup pilot to be added to flights lasting 8 hours or more, a more transparent system of promotion, a year-end bonus and other concessions.The airline has said it is willing to continue negotiations but that the union's demands in talks are different from those it makes in public, according to Taiwan's official Central News Agency.The airline said on its website that 18 flights had been canceled, including those bound for Hong Kong, Bangkok, Los Angeles, Manila and Tokyo. Earlier reports said 26 flights were expected to be canceled and the number of cancellations is expected to rise if the strike drags on.\"We deeply apologize to all the customers for any inconvenience about the pilots' strike,\" CAL said on its Facebook page. \"Most colleagues in China Airlines still stay at their position and provide the best flight service.\"The strike led to chaotic scenes at Taiwan's three main airports as angry passengers demanded answers from airline staff.The Lunar New Year is Taiwan's busiest travel period, with thousands flying home to island or taking trips abroad.

It was then that she and Kohler brothers, Ryan and Matthew, had a \"light-bulb moment.\"\"Instead of trying to solve the problem by cleaning the beaches every day, let's go to what the source of the problem is, and take the plastic bottle away,\" said Kerrigan, now 31.In 2016, the trio founded startup company Generation Water, based on the Thai resort island of Phuket.They partnered with Marriott, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest hotel brand, in January 2017 to come up with a sustainable alternative to plastic bottles that would be commercially competitive and meet the needs of resorts and authorities.Two years on, the South African-born entrepreneurs explained the workings of a pilot water plant at the JW Marriott Phuket Resort & Spa on Mai Khao beach, next to slogans saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cSave Water Drink Air\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMade 100% from the air.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHere, in the sweltering heat, two water generators suck in vapour from the air, which then condenses into water when it hits cold coils.The water drips into tanks, making 4,000 liters a day. It is filtered, minerals are added, and it is put into reusable glass bottles. These are placed into 445 guestrooms at the JW Marriott Phuket and neighboring Renaissance Phuket Resort & Spa.The bottled water is also being trialed at two Marriott vacation clubs nearby.The move is part of a wider effort on the holiday island to cut down on plastic bottles, rife in the hospitality industry, and a major problem in Asia and its travel hotspots.In many parts of Asia, tap water is unsafe to drink, so hotel guests get complimentary water, mostly in plastic bottles.As much as 60 percent of the plastic found in the ocean comes from five Asian nations, including Thailand, according to U.S.-based non-profit group Ocean Conservancy.In 2017, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific organized a forum to encourage sustainable water management on resort islands.On Phuket, which is half the size of Hong Kong, more hotels are being built, and water is already in short supply.Trucks navigate crowded roads as resorts without their own catchment area bring in water from reservoirs.Phuket was the world's 11th top city destination in 2017, with 11.6 million international arrivals, according to global research company Euromonitor International.To cope with the environmental impacts of this influx, nearly 70 hotels from the Phuket Hotels Association have pledged to cut plastic bottles and straws by the end of 2019.Since Marriott started producing its own water four months ago, it has stopped more than 100,000 plastic bottles from entering landfill or oceans, the chain says.It plans to expand the scheme to all Marriott resorts in southern Thailand, handing out 4 million glass bottles.Carsten Siebert, Marriott International's director of operations for Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar, said the company understood it had \"a greater obligation to operate responsibly given our expanding global footprint.\"The chain has a goal to reduce water consumption per occupied room by 20 percent between 2007 and 2020.The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwater from air\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology uses 78 percent less energy than producing standard bottled water, has a lower carbon footprint, and is about a third cheaper, Generation Water says.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe good thing is that it starts to become financially affordable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthias Y. Sutter, general manager at JW Marriott Phuket.Nor does the system rely on pulling water from the ground, rivers or lakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don't have to invest in land to secure our own water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kanokwan Homcha-aim, corporate social responsibility manager for the same Marriott hotel.Guests here have reacted positively since the bottled water was introduced in September, happy that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinally a big brand made a move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.They also like the taste. Michael Lawson, a lawyer from Sydney sitting at the Sala Sawasdee lobby bar, said his children were \"quite picky\" about water. \"But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very refreshing and they are fighting over it in the room,\" he said.Downstairs in the Siam Deli, teenage student Jeremy Frydman from Melbourne said it was better than tap water at home.One challenge for Generation Water is explaining the science behind the technology.Many guests ask about air pollution, for example. But the water collected is clean to start with, and the technology still works if the air is polluted as only water condenses, not the air or its contaminants, said Ryan Kohler.And with human activities emitting more greenhouse gases, the atmosphere is warming up, causing more water to evaporate, which further heats the air in \"a vicious circle,\" he added.The water-from-air system helps reduce this vapor, said Kerrigan, adding that it has no impact on rainfall levels.Thailand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food and drug administration approved Generation Water last August, and the company is now expanding.It is building a plant in Phuket, which will use solar energy to make \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate-positive\u00e2\u0080\u009d water, producing more than 20,000 liters of water per day by the end of the year.Nine Marriott resorts on Phuket are in the process of signing up, along with 30 other hotels.Generation Water is now eyeing the rest of Thailand, and is talking to hotels in Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Maldives, Kohler said.It also sells smaller water production units that can be used in homes, offices, classrooms and yachts.The company's goal is to stop 1 billion 500 ml plastic bottles from entering landfill and the oceans every year by the end of 2021--equal to supplying 3,000 hotels of 250 rooms.As for Marriott staff on Phuket, they have \"no excuse now,\" said Homcha-aim.Their birthday gift from the company will be a reusable tumbler, which they can fill up with \"water from the air.\"", "Asia welcomes Year of the Pig with banquets, temple visits,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,February,5,2019": "BEIJING--Asia welcomed the lunar Year of the Pig on Tuesday with visits to temples, family banquets and the world's biggest travel spree.Celebrations took place throughout the region, from Beijing and Seoul to Hanoi and Singapore.The streets of Beijing and other major Chinese cities were quiet and empty after millions of people left to visit relatives or travel abroad during the year's biggest family holiday.Families gathered at home for multigenerational banquets.

The last remaining restrictions are on vegetables, fruits and dairy products from Fukushima.Fukushima Governor Masao Uchibori visited Hong Kong in late January.Hong Kong was Fukushima\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top customer before the 2011 disaster. Eighty percent of the prefecture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agricultural exports went there.Uchibori strongly asserted the safety of Fukushima\u00e2\u0080\u0099s produce, but failed to obtain a commitment from the Hong Kong government to resume imports.\u00e2\u0080\u009c(Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) perceptions about Fukushima (are unchanged), and anxieties, worries and concerns remain deep-rooted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor noted.He must have sensed that acutely from interacting with locals.When I was stationed in Hong Kong in the past, even for a short while, I was aware of the high trust locals placed in Japanese food.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's expensive, but safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was told repeatedly.Perhaps the lingering negative publicity surrounding Fukushima produce is the flip side of the absolute trust people used to have for many years.Whether at home or abroad, it is hard to focus on a goal when fighting negative publicity.

Boar have charged down hikers, raided rubbish tips and camp sites, and even scampered through a shopping mall and a runway at the airport.\"Most Hong Kong wild boars, at this point, have already lost their fear of humans,\" said Roni Wong, a member of a community group campaigning for the protection of wild boars.\"The cause of it is feeding, which causes them to lose their natural instincts,\" added Wong who has identified numerous spots where residents feed wild animals in violation of local wildlife protection laws.The habituation of boars to humans has brought some safety concerns. Complaints against wild pigs have more than doubled since 2013, with over 700 incidents reported in 2017, including some attacks on people.\"A lot of the residents who used to take part in outdoor leisure activities, especially at night, are no longer doing that,\" said Jeremy Young, a district councilor for the Peak, an affluent area with a conspicuous boar population in its woods.\"They are scared. You don't want to run into a 250 pound (113 kilogram) male pig with tusks.\"The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said in a statement to Reuters that some pigs \"pose imminent risks to public safety, particularly those which have attacked people, or are accustomed to searching for food around built-up areas and also getting easily irritated.\"Young believes the government should once again allow the selective culling of boars by \"civilian hunting teams\" to mitigate the porcine threat, a practice that was suspended in 2017 after an outcry by animal rights groups.The AFCD, however, rejected this proposal.Instead, it said it would take measures to put down, or relocate troublesome pigs to wilder areas, and to fit some with GPS trackers.Authorities say they don't know the size of Hong Kong's wild pig population, nor whether numbers have actually increased or whether they're just venturing more frequently into urban areas.\"Most Hongkongers won't mind the wild boars,\" said 40-year-old taxi driver Water Siu, shortly after a boar interrupted his Sunday barbecue in the Aberdeen country park.\"In fact, we see them as our neighbors.\"", "Hong Kong police destroy WWI grenade found in potatoes,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,February,4,2019": "HONG KONG--A Hong Kong police bomb squad on Saturday destroyed a World War I-era hand grenade found at a food-processing facility in a shipment of potatoes from France, news reports said.Employees reported a suspicious object encased in mud at the facility in Tseung Kwan O district in the New Territories, according to the Sing Tao Daily newspaper and other outlets.A bomb squad concluded the 1-kilogram object was a hand grenade, possibly made in Germany.Officers moved cars and piled sandbags around the grenade, then detonated it, according to Sing Tao, the Observer and other outlets.No injuries were reported.

Beijing has responded with a security clampdown condemned by rights groups and Western governments.Frontier Services Group (FSG), a Hong Kong-listed company founded by Prince, said in a Chinese-language statement posted on its website on Jan. 22 that it had signed a deal to build a training centre in southern Xinjiang.Reuters reported on the statement on Thursday.A Prince spokesman told Reuters on Friday that Prince had \"no knowledge or involvement whatsoever with this preliminary memorandum regarding the company's activity in Xinjiang.\"\"Any potential investment of this nature would require the knowledge and input of each FSG Board member and a formal Board resolution,\" the spokesman said in an email.Prince is deputy chairman, a minority shareholder and a board member of FSG, a security, logistics and insurance provider.The former U.S. Navy SEAL officer is the brother of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. He founded the U.S. military contractor formerly called Blackwater that drew international scrutiny and faced lawsuits for shootings and other conduct in Iraq. It now operates as Virginia-based Academi.A Hong Kong-based spokesman for FSG told Reuters on Friday that the statement was \"published in error by a staff member in Beijing\" and had been taken off FSG's website.The removed statement had said that FSG signed a deal with the Kashgar Caohu industrial park in Tumxuk city in southern Xinjiang to build a training centre.The Tumxuk government did not answer a phone call seeking comment on Friday.The statement did not provide details but said a signing ceremony in Beijing on Jan. 11 was attended by officials from Tumxuk city and CITIC Guoan Construction, owned by state-run conglomerate CITIC Group, which took a controlling stake in FSG last March.A state media report had said FSG would invest 40 million yuan ($6 million) in the centre, which will have the capacity to train 8,000 people a year.In a March 2018 stock exchange filing, FSG said that it intends to set up a \"secured logistics business\" in Pakistan and Xinjiang.In May 2017, it acquired a 25 percent stake in a security training facility in Beijing, which it said was the largest such school in China and would allow FSG to provide \"world-class training courses\" to Chinese companies.Hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in the security clampdown in Xinjiang.China has defended the measures as \"de-radicalisation\" that has prevented violence by providing vocational training to people susceptible to \"extremist\" thought.", "Hong Kong customs seize record haul of pangolin scales bound for Vietnam,REUTERS,February,2,2019": "HONG KONG-- Hong Kong customs busted a massive endangered species smuggling operation from Africa, seizing a record quantity of pangolin scales along with more than 1,000 ivory tusks, as authorities step up the fight against illegal wildlife trafficking.The value of the seized goods - which equates to around 500 elephants and up to 13,000 pangolins - was over HK$62 million, ($7.90 million) officials said on Friday. Originating in Nigeria, the shipment was bound for Vietnam, they added.In a separate incident, customs officials in the northern Vietnamese port of Hai Phong discovered another 1.4 tonnes of pangolin scales in a shipping container sent from Nigeria, the state-run Vietnam News Agency reported on Friday.Last October, Vietnam intercepted more than eight metric tonnes of pangolin scales and ivory, also from Nigeria, in one of the Southeast Asian country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest wildlife trafficking cases for years.The Chinese territory of Hong Kong, located on the country's southern coast, is a global blackspot for wildlife trafficking. The city is a key transit point, supplying an array of wildlife products including timber, shark's fin and rhino horn across Asia and particularly mainland China.Customs on January 16th, seized about 8,300 kilograms of pangolin scales and 2,100 kilograms of ivory tusks at the Kwai Chung cargo port located in the former British colony.It was the largest single seizure of pangolin parts in Hong Kong.Yueng Ka-yan, head of command at Hong Kong's Customs and Excise Department, said the smugglers used a new method to hide the endangered species by a process of 'solidification' where they used ice bags and frozen meat to obscure the species.\"The low temperature environment created by the ice bags and frozen meat helped mask the distinctive smell of the pangolin scales.\"Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are critically endangered. They are coveted for their meat -- considered a delicacy -- and their scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat aliments from cancer to arthritis.\"It is clearly impossible that the pangolin species can withstand such high rates of poaching, trafficking and trade. Eight tonnes is outrageous,\" said Alex Hofford, campaign manager for conservation group WildAid in Hong Kong.WildAid estimates 100,000 pangolins are poached from the wild each year, with all 8 species of pangolin in Africa, and especially Asia, now under threat.Customs officials who worked with their mainland counterparts to intercept the goods, found the species buried under frozen meat inside a refrigerated container.Officials said two people had been arrested in connection with the case.In a 2018 review released on Thursday, customs officials said there had been a 72 percent increase in seizures of endangered species with the total volume of goods seized increasing more than treble.ADM Capital Foundation, which focuses on environmental challenges across Asia, wrote in a January report that wildlife trafficking should be incorporated under Hong Kong's Organised and Serious Crime Ordinance (OSCO).Doing so would provide \"a powerful disincentive to wildlife criminals, and importantly, would prevent reinvestment of profits into further criminal activities,\" the report said.

A full sex change would require the removal of female sexual organs, making them sterile.Appearing in court, Tse unfurled a banner that read, \"Forced Sterilization is cruel and inhumane. Recognize our Rights NOW!\"In his ruling, Judge Thomas Au wrote that \"the change of gender entry stated in the ID card does not only concern the private right of the transgender person but also the wider public interest.\"Like many Asian societies, Hong Kong has become more open about gender issues, although the legal system is sometimes slow to follow.Amnesty International called the judgment \"a missed opportunity to address the discrimination transgender people in Hong Kong face.\"\"No one should be forced to undergo gender affirming surgery in order to have their gender legally recognized,\" Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said in a statement.Friday's decision follows a ruling last week by Japan's Supreme Court upholding a law that effectively requires transgender people to be sterilized before they can have their gender changed on official documents. That ruling was widely denounced by human rights and LGBT activists and may spark further legal action.Japan is one of many countries with a sterilization requirement. In 2017, the European Court of Human Rights said 22 of the countries under its jurisdiction still required sterilization as part of a legal gender change, and it ordered them to end the practice.Maria Sjodin, deputy executive director of OutRight Action International, which monitors LGBT rights issues worldwide, said she was unsure if all 22 of those countries have fully implemented the court's order.In Hong Kong, the judgment seemed at odds with a 2013 ruling that allowed a transgender woman known as W to have her gender changed to female on her identity card. W had successfully sued in the city's highest legal body, the Court of Final Appeal, for her right to marry her boyfriend.Following that case, the city's Equal Opportunities Commission recommended that the government drop the requirement for complete sex reassignment. The government in 2017 held a public consultation on whether the commission's recommendations should adopted but has yet to release the findings.", "Hong Kong film hotspot Avenue of Stars reopens in Kowloon,By YUICHIRO MASUMITSU/ Correspondent,February,1,2019": "HONG KONG--The Avenue of Stars, a popular tourist attraction showcasing the glory of Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movie industry, particularly its iconic martial arts flicks, reopened on Jan. 31 after years of renovation.The promenade is on the waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui, a bustling shopping and entertainment district in the Kowloon Peninsula's south end.A statue of martial arts legend Bruce Lee in his signature fighting pose stands tall against the backdrop of Victoria Harbor and skyscrapers. The bronze cast image of the U.S.-born actor, who died at age 32 in 1973, used to be mounted on a stone before the renovation, but now stands on a pedestal filled with water.A bronze statue of Anita Mui, Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beloved pop music diva and award-winning film actress, is also exhibited in the promenade. Mui died at age 40 in 2003.The handprints of more than 100 celebrities grace the handrails of fall-prevention railings.

The total revenue figure of 24.9 billion patacas dropped month on month from December last year but was the same as November's monthly figure.Macau, located on China's southern coast and the country's only legal casino hub, is highly reliant on gambling revenue for its finances, with taxes from the casinos accounting over 80 percent of the government's revenue.Authorities have asked operators to diversify from solely gambling and broaden Macau's economic base in order to lessen the territory's dependence on the glitzy casinos.They have also been pushing the six casino concessionaires--Sands China, Wynn Macau, SJM Holdings, MGM China, Melco Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment--to provide more non-gaming amenities in a bid to diversify.Licenses of the concessionaires begin to expire next year, but there is no clarity yet on what happens after that.Revenue growth is likely to remain moderate in 2019 as concerns about China's growth weighed on gambling appetite of players in the high-roller VIP segment, analysts said.Nevertheless, casino executives are bullish on the potential benefits from the opening last year of the world's longest sea-crossing bridge and tunnel, linking Macau to the financial center of Hong Kong and mainland China's Pearl River Delta.The bridge connects Hong Kong's international airport to the casino hub in just over half an hour. Prior to the bridge opening, visitors would have to take a one-hour ferry ride from the former British colony to Macau.Authorities are also hoping it will boost the development of Macau's convention and exhibition business and lift overnight visitation numbers, which help drive non-gaming revenue.", "Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough talk on Taiwan backfires, as Tsai support surges,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,January,31,2019": "TAIPEI--Chinese President Xi Jinping sought to push Taiwanese closer to unification with a new year speech mixing carrots and sticks.That hasn't panned out. Instead, his independence-leaning Taiwanese counterpart, Tsai Ing-wen, has enjoyed a surge in support following a brutal drubbing of her political party in local elections last year, according to public opinion surveys and interviews.The residents of this self-governing island, with its vibrant and well-established democracy, are as much inclined as ever to resist China's demands despite rising political, economic and military threats from Beijing.Xi's offer to Taiwan \"is a total scam,\" said Kuo Lin-han, 26, a Chinese Culture University student in Taipei.Kuo was referring to China's proposal of a \"one country, two systems\" arrangement that Xi renewed in his Jan. 2 speech, under which Taiwan would accept Chinese sovereignty while being allowed to retain its own economic and legal systems.That's based on the framework Hong Kong was granted when it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, an arrangement that has become increasingly frayed as Beijing expands its political influence in the former British colony.Jarringly for many Taiwanese, Xi mixed his outreach with a reminder that Beijing had no intention of dropping its threat to use military force to bring the island under its control.Xi's speech was seized on by Tsai, who went on a four-day media blitz in Taipei that appears to have significantly bolstered her support among voters.In a telephone survey published Jan. 21 by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation, 34.5 percent of the 1,074 respondents gave her a thumbs-up, an increase of about 10 percentage points from after the November elections. Two-thirds said they want Taiwan to continue its self-rule or declare formal independence.Separately, the Taiwan government's Mainland Affairs Council found in a Jan. 17 survey of 1,078 people that 75.4 percent oppose \"one country, two systems,\" 74.3 percent dispute the \"one China\" condition for formal dialogue and 77.2 percent oppose China for holding pledges that it could use force against Taiwan if needed.Both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.\"The most important thing is that Xi Jinping made the speech on Taiwan and Tsai Ing-wen gave a rare response, which received a high level of support,\" foundation chairman You Ying-lung said. \"The China factor helps her come out of a trough.\"Younger Taiwanese have a firm sense of local identity that stands in the way of China's idea for unification, said Wu Yi-hsuan, 27, an energy science and engineering doctoral student.\"We want to be Taiwanese Taiwan rather than Chinese Taiwan,\" Wu said, referring to the terminology Beijing often uses for the island that many consider condescending. \"Regarding the fact that the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan for a second, this (two systems) policy of China's is more an invasive, aggressive and offensive one.\"China ruled Taiwan loosely under the former Qing dynasty and the island was made a Japanese colony in 1895. Handed over to Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists at the end of World War II, it split again from the mainland in 1949 during the civil war with the Communist Party under Mao Tse-tung.The Communists have regarded Taiwan since then as a breakaway territory that must eventually be brought into the fold. Many commentators say they believe Xi sees that as his historical mission, prompting major increases in China's military budget and renewed pressure on the island, including cutting off contacts with Tsai's government.China's huge economy and global clout may have some effect, but most Taiwanese are unimpressed with how Beijing has followed through on its earlier pledges, said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the think tank Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies.\"Hong Kong is totally controlled by mainland China,\" Yang said. \"Even though they have their autonomy, they have limited freedom, and certainly there is no democracy in Hong Kong, as far as Taiwanese are concerned.\"\"I feel that the China government is unpredictable especially after Lee Ming-che was taken away by them,\" said Catta Chou, 30, a worker in a nongovernmental organization, referring to a Taiwanese citizen sentenced in China in 2017 to five years in prison for spreading pro-democracy information.\"China is definitely crazy,\" Chou said.Despite such sentiments, China is unlikely to come up with a new proposal in the immediate future, said Yun Sun, East Asia Program senior associate with the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, D.C.Beijing's leaders \"know how unpopular the proposal has been and will be,\" Sun said. \"But before they have a good alternative, this is and will be the biggest deal for them.\"Voters had complained before the Nov. 24 midterm elections that Tsai had either grown too distant from China to build economic ties or hadn't stood up enough to Beijing's military and diplomatic pressure.Though she won the presidency by a landslide in 2016--largely due to concerns about China's influence--and her Democratic Progressive Party received its first-ever legislative majority, Taiwanese voters have in the past shown a willingness to try new approaches.Many in the business community are already urging Tsai to climb down from her refusal to meet Beijing's \"one China\" demand, largely as a way of easing pressure on the island.\"'One country, two systems' could bring more people in and out, and this is good,\" said dried fruit merchant Yu Chen-ching, 65. \"Otherwise, no one wants to visit Taiwan, and it's not good for the economy.\"Economic concerns could cause Tsai's popularity to fade before her party faces the 2020 presidential race, said Alex Chiang, international relations professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei.\"Because she's president, she has to be firm on her position toward China, but in reality, Taiwan still has to do business with China,\" Chiang said.", "Huawei lawyer: Meng a \u00e2\u0080\u0098hostage\u00e2\u0080\u0099 after U.S. presses charges,REUTERS,January,29,2019": "WASHINGTON/HONG KONG--Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou \"should not be a hostage\" in Sino-U.S. relations, her lawyer said on Tuesday, after the United States announced criminal charges against Meng and the Chinese firm just days before crunch trade talks with Beijing.The Justice Department charged Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and its chief financial officer with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide and that was reported on by Reuters in 2012.In a separate case, the Justice Department charged the telecommunications equipment maker with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc. Huawei has said the companies settled their dispute in 2017.CFO Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1, a move which was followed by China arresting two Canadians on national security grounds. She is scheduled in court on Tuesday to discuss her bail terms, and is subject to a U.S. extradition request.Her lawyer Reid Weingarten, partner at Steptoe & Johnson, pointed to \"complex\" Sino-U.S. relations.\"Our client, Sabrina Meng, should not be a pawn or a hostage in this relationship. Ms. Meng is an ethical and honorable businesswoman who has never spent a second of her life plotting to violate any U.S. law, including the Iranian sanctions.\"Huawei said it had sought to discuss the charges with U.S. authorities \"but the request was rejected without explanation.\"It said it \"denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations\" and \"is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng.\"China's foreign ministry urged the United States drop the arrest warrant and end \"unreasonable suppression\" of Chinese companies. Spokesman Geng Shuang also said China had issued stern representations to both Canada and the United States after the U.S. formally issued its extradition request for Meng.Canada's Justice Minister has 30 days from receipt of the request to decide whether to grant authority to proceed. If granted, Meng's case would be sent to the British Columbia Supreme Court for a hearing, which could take weeks or months.The development is likely to upset talks between Beijing and Washington this week as part of negotiations intended to walk back trade tensions between the globe's two largest economies.U.S. President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Meng's case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the charges are \"wholly separate\" from the trade negotiations.Huawei makes equipment including base stations, switches and routers, as well as consumer products such as smartphones, and derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.Its global reach has come under attack from the United States, which is trying to prevent U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are concerned the gear could be used by China's government for espionage--a concern Huawei calls unfounded.Australia and New Zealand followed the U.S. lead in restricting market access over the past year. On Tuesday, TPG Telecom Ltd. canceled the Huawei-based mobile phone network it was building, in the first commercial casualty of Australia's move.Huawei nevertheless said it is the world's leading provider of 5G technology, winning 30 contracts globally--more than any of its competitors--including 18 in Europe.It is unclear how the U.S. charges would impact its business. Last year, Chinese peer ZTE Corp. was prevented from buying essential components from U.S. firms after pleading guilty to similar charges, crippling its operations.ZTE resumed normal business after paying up to $1.4 billion (153 billion yen) in fines and replacing its entire board, on top of a near $900 million penalty paid in 2017.U.S. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said the alleged criminal activity at Huawei \"goes back at least 10 years and goes all the way to the top of the company.\" The charges against Meng and Huawei cite the Reuters stories that said Huawei's Skycom unit sought to sell goods to Iran.The indictment noted that denials from Huawei in the stories were relied upon by financial institutions \"in determining whether to continue their banking relationships with Huawei and its subsidiaries.\"The indictment featured a meeting in August 2013 between Meng and an executive from an unidentified bank. Sources told Reuters the bank is HSBC Holdings PLC, which paid $1.92 billion in 2012 for violating U.S. anti-money-laundering and sanctions laws.During the meeting, Meng misrepresented Huawei operations in Iran and ownership and control of Skycom, the indictment showed.The Justice Department has confirmed that HSBC is not under investigation in this case, HSBC said in a statement last month.Also according to the indictment, in July 2007, the FBI interviewed Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and U.S. authorities said he falsely told them Huawei did not violate U.S. export laws.The indictment concerning trade secret theft alleged that Huawei had a formal policy instituting a bonus program to reward employees who stole confidential information from competitors.FBI Director Christopher Wray said the Huawei cases, filed in New York and Washington state, \"expose Huawei's brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace.\"", "China jailing of website founder aims at grassroots activism,REUTERS,January,29,2019": "BEIJING--A Chinese court on Tuesday sentenced the founder of a website that reported on human rights abuses to five years in jail for \"inciting subversion\" of state power, a verdict decried by a rights group as part of a campaign to bury grassroots activism.Since coming to power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping drive to stifle activism that challenges the ruling Communist Party.Liu Feiyue, the founder of msguancha.com, a news portal that covers government corruption, police abuses and human rights issues, was arrested in late 2016 and charged with \"inciting subversion of state power.\"The Intermediate People's Court sentenced Liu to five years in prison and seized more than one million yuan ($148,326) of his personal assets, according to the website of the court in Suizhou city in Hubei province.It was not possible to contact Liu for comment.\"I really can't understand it. All I know is that Liu Feiyue just set up a website for internet users to write about social issues and inequality,\" Liu's mother Ding Qihua, 76, told Reuters by phone.She said the sentence was harsher than expected, given that the family had hoped for leniency by complying fully with the court's requests.There was no response when Reuters called the Suizhou court on Tuesday.China rejects criticism of its human rights record, saying it is a country with rule of law and that jailed rights lawyers and activists are criminals who have broken the law.Hundreds of rights lawyers have been detained and dozens jailed in a series of arrests commonly known as \"709\" cases, referring to July 9, 2015, when a countrywide operation rounded up core members of the group.On Monday, in the last of the \"709\" cases to go to trial, a court jailed rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang for 4-1/2 years on charges of subversion.Aside from targeting lawyers, Beijing has also in recent years clamped down on grassroots activism and muckraking websites, in what rights groups say is an attempt to cut off rights activism at its roots.\"Prosecuting the editor of a human rights website shows just how frightened the Chinese government is about independent reporting on abuses from inside China,\" Yaqiu Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.", "Boat tours to see floating ice floes start in eastern Hokkaido,By ATSUSH ISHIMA/ Staff Writer,January,27,2019": "ABASHIRI, Hokkaido--Timed with the arrival of ice floes on the eastern coast of Hokkaido, a sightseeing ice-breaker ship carries travelers from home and abroad to witness the spectacular winter spectacle.The vessel, named the Aurora, left the port here on Jan. 26 on its first tour this year of the drift ice.Less than an hour later, the ship reached the area covered with an infinite number of ice floes and sailed slowly through them to allow passengers to marvel at the sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my first time to see floating ice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a 65-year-old man from Nihonmatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, who joined the tour with his wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is nice to know the ice came from the Amur river.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPassengers, including those from Taiwan and Hong Kong, gazed at the ice floes and snapped selfies with the drift ice in the background.
