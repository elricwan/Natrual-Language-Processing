       "'HONG KONG--Thousands of people marched on Hong Kong\\'s parliament on Sunday to demand the scrapping of proposed extradition rules that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial--a move which some fear puts the city\\'s core freedoms at risk.Opponents of the proposal fear further erosion of rights and legal protections in the free-wheeling financial hub--freedoms which were guaranteed under the city\\'s handover from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.Early estimates suggested several thousand people had joined the march along Hong Kong Island from Causeway Bay to the council in the Admiralty business district.Veteran Hong Kong activist and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung said the government\\'s move risked removing Hong Kongers\\' \"freedom from fear.\"\"Hong Kong people and visitors passing by Hong Kong will lose their right not to be extradited into mainland China,\" he said. \"They would need to face an unjust legal system on the mainland.\"The proposed changes have sparked an unusually broad chorus of concern from international business elites to lawyers and rights\\' groups and even some pro-establishment figures.Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong who handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997, on Saturday described the move \"as an assault on Hong Kong\\'s values, stability and security,\" government-funded broadcaster RTHK reported.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other government officials are standing fast by their proposals, saying they are vital to plug long-standing loopholes.Under the changes, the Hong Kong leader would have the right to order the extradition of wanted offenders to China, Macau and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong\\'s existing extradition treaties.As a safeguard such orders, to be issued case-by-case, could be challenged and appealed through the city\\'s vaunted legal system. But they will no longer be subject to review by the council as before, according to the government\\'s plan.Government officials have said no-one at risk of the death penalty or torture or facing a political charge could be sent from Hong Kong. Under pressure from local business groups, they earlier exempted nine commercial crimes from the new provisions.The proposals could be passed into law later in the year, with the city\\'s pro-democratic camp no longer holding enough seats to block the move.The government has justified the swift introduction of the changes by saying they are needed so a young Hong Kong man suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan can be extradited to face charges there.Sunday\\'s march comes amid renewed calls for deeper electoral reforms stalled five years ago after the so-called Occupy protest movement paralyzed key parts of the city for 11 weeks to demand genuine full democracy.Four leaders of the movement were last week sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight to 16 months, part of a group of nine activists found guilty after a near month-long trial.'"

       "'HONG KONG--Overseas, Joshua Wong has emerged as a prominent face of Hong Kong\\'s months-long protests for full democracy. At home, he is just another protester.The 22-year-old activist, who rose to fame as a leader of democracy protests five years ago, speaks to a U.S. congressional committee on Tuesday, following visits to Germany and Taiwan to drum up support for the movement.While not diminishing the importance of that role, other protesters say Wong does not speak for what is purposefully a leaderless movement. He has received media coverage, both because he is well-known and the movement is largely faceless, since many protesters speak only anonymously and wear masks to try to avoid arrest.\"Not that nobody cares about what he says, but it\\'s just that Joshua Wong alone cannot represent the whole of Hong Kong,\" said Sean Au, a 17-year-old student. \"He is just a participant, no longer a leader.\"His activities have nonetheless made him a target of the Chinese government, which has used him to accuse foreign powers of colluding with anti-China separatists to foment unrest.Wong\\'s activism started at age 13 when he joined protests against a proposed high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and mainland China. The link opened last year after many delays.The bespectacled teen set up a student activist group, Scholarism, months later and rallied more than 100,000 people to protest a plan to implement mandatory patriotic education in schools. The government eventually dropped the plan.It was the 2014 Umbrella Revolution that propelled Wong into the global spotlight. Protesters occupied major thoroughfares in the semiautonomous Chinese territory for 79 days in an ultimately unsuccessful push for direct elections for the city\\'s leaders.Wong co-founded a political party, Demosisto, in 2016, but its members were disqualified from serving and later even running for office because they advocated self-determination. He remains secretary-general of the organization, which now describes itself on Twitter as a movement-oriented youth activist group.Wong, who has been arrested and jailed repeatedly, was released in June, days after more than a million people took to the streets to protest an extradition bill which is widely regarded as an example of China chipping away at the city\\'s autonomy.He was rearrested last month along with several others and charged with organizing an illegal rally outside a police station in June.While Wong has inspired many, neither he nor other well-known individuals or groups have a central role in this summer\\'s mass movement, said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several massive marches this summer.Leung acknowledged that Wong\\'s reputation as the poster child of the 2014 protest gives him stature as a protest representative on the global stage, along with others such as Hong Kong pop star Denise Ho.\"Globally we need actions that will make (the Hong Kong and Beijing governments) think twice before they act,\" she said. \"Joshua Wong is a well-known face across the world and he can help in this.\"Wong and Ho are among five people due to speak at a hearing of the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China titled \"Hong Kong\\'s Summer of Discontent and U.S. Policy Responses.\"They hope to rally support for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill proposing economic sanctions and penalties on Chinese and Hong Kong officials found to have suppressed democracy in the city.Mousse Chan, a 45-year-old teacher, said she supports Wong in his global tour, though she echoed the view that he is not their leader.\"We believe that every Hong Kong citizen has a responsibility to raise awareness about our cause and he is just one of them,\" she said.Wong has accused the government of trying to frame prominent activists such as himself as a warning to other protesters, but he said it was doomed to fail as the current unrest has no centralized figureheads.Born in 1996 to a middle-class Christian family, Wong has said his passion was ignited after his father started taking him to poorer areas when he was a young child. He has written a book called \"I Am Not a Hero\" and featured in a Netflix documentary entitled \"Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower.\"Ahead of his trip to Germany this month, he made headlines in Berlin after suggesting that two panda cubs--born to pandas rented from China at the Berlin Zoo--be named \"Democracy\" and \"Freedom\" to send a clear signal to China.He later compared Hong Kong with East Germany during the pro-democracy protests that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Beijing has rebuked German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas for meeting Wong, saying he disrespected China\\'s sovereignty.Wong tweeted Sunday that human rights clauses should be included in the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China.\"I see no reason for us to give up and it\\'s time for the world to stand with Hong Kong,\" he said.'"
