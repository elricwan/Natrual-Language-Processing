617	0	a	I hope that the pundits dont lose sight of the fact that todays vote in NH shows that if Sanders wins with his current 28%, that means that 72% of people didnt vote for him and 40+% voted for Buttigieg and Klobuchar in the left-center lane. #WinTheEra
618	0	a	Maybe. But it would have been easier for them to pick someone who was in the same lane as Biden, but younger b/c the coordination problem among a small group of actors is not as severe. There was no way for a Bullock or Bennet to get attention in the current set up.
619	0	a	The biggest problem this is all revealing to me is that some folks in the center/left lane need to drop out. Just imagine if this was Pete/Sanders right now. He would be destroying Bernie. Also, I don't really think Warren's voters automatically translate to Bernie.

640	0	a	If you watched Bennet later in the campaign, on CNN or MSNBC or at any of his town halls on C-SPAN, you could see real improvement as a candidate, but not enough to make any kind of lasting impression. He was in the same lane as Amy Klobuchar, who in the last week set NH afire.

646	0	a	I would just go the lanes where you plan to Bowl most of the time. I would check with the shop pro if they have one. If not then ask at counter what type of lane conditions they have (wood, or synthetic, oil patterns, etc) and ask for ball recommendations there.
647	0	a	Pretty misleading since its now a two person race. The more accurate critique would be to point out that 28 percent is low for the winner of NH. Still, Bernie deserves credit for winning the progressive lane after several candidates tried to take it away from him.
648	0	a	With the closing of Market St to cars in SF and the addition of Atlantic bike lane in all but 3 blocks of my commute from house to work is bike-friendly. At least 40% in protected lanes. Thank you city leaders &amp; all who made it happen.

651	0	a	If Biden can't win SC (and I think...that's a real possibility right now), he's going to drop out. If Bernie wins NV, it may not matter if Biden wins SC. Basically, NV could be the center-left lane's Waterloo. If you can't beat Bernie there, buh-bye.
